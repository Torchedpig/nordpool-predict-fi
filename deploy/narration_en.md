The higher prices of the weekend and early week are partly explained by the low level of wind power. On Saturday, wind power will be abundant, with an average of 5596 MW, but on Sunday, production will fall to an average of 1888 MW. On Monday, wind power is predicted to be an average of 1763 MW, which is clearly below normal.
