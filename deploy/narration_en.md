The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage. The outage started on 1.3.2025 at 03:00 and is estimated to end on 29.4.2025 at 01:00. The maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data during plant outages is limited.

The electricity prices in the coming week will be variable. Prices will rise somewhat in the early part of the week, while significantly decreasing later in the week. Clearly the highest prices will occur on **Wednesday**, with an expected daily average of 5.3 cents and a daily peak of 10.6 cents. There is a significant risk of price spikes on Wednesday, and individual hourly prices could rise up to 20 cents. The most expensive hours on Wednesday will occur in the morning, between approximately 08:00 and 10:00, when prices exceed 10 cents.

On Tuesday and next Monday, electricity prices will remain moderate, despite some price variation within both days. Daily average prices will be between three and four cents, and price peaks will not significantly raise the daily maximum. Next Monday, the highest hourly price is expected in the evening, approximately between 18:00 and 20:00, reaching 7.9 cents.

Thursday is a public holiday, which will reduce electricity demand and result in favorable price expectations. Thursday‚Äôs average price will only be 1.3 cents, although the highest prices of the day, 4.2 cents, will be seen in the morning between 08:00 and 10:00. Thursday and Friday prices will be overall affordable, with Friday‚Äôs average price at just 1.2 cents.

Over the weekend, prices will drop to negative values. On **Saturday** and Sunday, daily averages will fall below zero, meaning consumers could momentarily receive small compensation for electricity usage. Saturday‚Äôs lowest hourly price (-1.6 cents) will appear early in the morning between 04:00 and 06:00. Similarly, Sunday's lowest price (-1.3 cents) will occur in the early morning hours between 02:00 and 04:00.

The weekend's exceptionally low prices can largely be attributed to abundant wind power production, which will remain at very high levels throughout the weekend. Sunday's wind power generation will be particularly high, reaching over 4,800 MW.
