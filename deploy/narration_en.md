The forecast for market electricity prices in the coming days shows moderate fluctuations in daily averages. **Tuesday** starts with a relatively low average price of 2.8 cents per kilowatt-hour, and prices remain within a fairly narrow range throughout the day. Wind power production varies but generally stays at a normal level.

On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, slightly higher maximum prices are expected, reaching 6.2 cents on Wednesday and 7.6 cents on Thursday. Both days also carry a risk of notably higher hourly price spikes, which could rise up to ten cents. On these days, the minimum wind power production falls clearly below 2,000 megawatts, which partly explains the potential for higher hourly prices. Thursday's minimum wind output is exceptionally low at only 606 megawatts, and the day's highest hourly price is forecasted for the morning between 08:00 and 10:00.

**Friday** sees the price expectations climb to the week's peak, with an average price of 4.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. Wind power production is also among the lowest of the week, reflected particularly in higher prices during the morning and daytime hours. Friday also brings an elevated risk of individual hourly price spikes, which may occur during the late morning or early evening.

Over the weekend, the price level stabilizes. **Saturday**'s average price settles at 3.2 cents, with daily volatility remaining moderate. Although Saturday could also see occasional price spikes for individual hours, the maximum prices in the table do not rise as high as during the weekdays.

**Sunday** is a public holiday, during which electricity demand may be lower than usual. This is reflected in the lowest average price of the week, at 1.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. The lowest hourly price even drops into negative territory, occurring in the afternoon and early evening. While Sunday’s average price remains well below other days, there is still a risk of individual price spikes reaching up to ten cents.

Next **Monday**, electricity prices are forecast to return closer to the levels seen at the start of the week, with an average of 2.5 cents. Monday also carries a risk of possible price spikes for individual hours, especially during the first half of the day.
