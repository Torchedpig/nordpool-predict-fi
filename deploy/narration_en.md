*Electricity prices will remain moderate for most of the coming week, but prices on Tuesday may temporarily surge above 20 cents per kilowatt-hour; Olkiluoto 3's maintenance outage affects forecast accuracy.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is undergoing a maintenance outage. The outage began on 1 March 2025 at 03:00, with an estimated completion time of 2 May 2025 at 02:00. The maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of electricity price forecasts, as training data during outage periods is limited.

The forecast was updated on Saturday at 21:00.

In the coming week's electricity price forecast, Tuesday clearly stands out. Tuesday's average price is expected to be the highest of the week, around 6.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. Intraday variations are also significant; between 9:00 in the morning and 20:00 in the evening on Tuesday, prices may rise above 15 cents, making Tuesday clearly the week's most expensive day. Additionally, there is an elevated risk of short-term price spikes on Tuesday, with prices potentially reaching as high as 20–30 cents. This spike risk is particularly associated with very low wind power generation, which will hit a minimum of 224 megawatts on Tuesday.

On other days of the week, average electricity prices will remain very moderate. On **Monday** and **Thursday**, prices will range between 1–2 cents, while on **Wednesday**, **Friday**, and **Sunday**, average prices will even remain below one cent. On **Saturday**, electricity prices will remain negative on average throughout the day, meaning consumers could even receive a small payment for consuming electricity at certain hours.

Negative prices will also appear on individual hours on other days. For example, on Monday morning between 03:00 and 05:00, electricity prices will drop to -1.5 cents. Also on Friday and Saturday, electricity prices will occasionally dip below zero cents, reflecting abundant wind power production and moderate demand.

At the end of the week there is one public holiday, **Friday**, when electricity demand is expected to be lower than usual. This could further reduce electricity prices, with Friday's average price expected to remain very low, about 0.2 cents.

Overall, electricity prices will remain very moderate in the coming week, apart from Tuesday. However, price variations will be significant, especially on Tuesday evening, when hourly prices could become exceptionally high.
