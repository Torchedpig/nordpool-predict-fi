Electricity price expectations for the coming week will remain mostly at a very moderate level. At the start of the week, especially on **Monday**, the average electricity price is expected to stay at 2.8 cents. During the day, prices will fluctuate slightly below zero up to 5.5 cents. However, there is a risk of price spikes reaching up to 10 cents during individual hours, particularly during the busier morning and evening periods.

**Tuesday** and **Wednesday** will continue this affordable trend, with average prices at 2.7 and 2.5 cents respectively. Wind power production will remain somewhat lower on these days, which may explain a slight increase in daily maximum prices. The possibility of price spikes remains, with the highest hourly prices likely during the late morning and early evening hours.

In the middle of the week, prices will see a clear rise. **Thursday**'s average price increases to 3.9 cents and **Friday**'s to 4.6 cents. On these days, minimum wind power production drops below normal, which is also reflected in the daily maximum prices: Thursday peaks at 6.3 cents and Friday at 7.5 cents. The most expensive hours of the week will occur on Friday evening, especially between 19:00 and 21:00. On these days, there is also a risk of hourly price spikes up to 10 cents.

Over the weekend, the price level will moderate again. **Saturday**'s average electricity price will remain at 3 cents, with a range of 1.5–4.8 cents. Wind power production will still be relatively low, but price variation within the day will not be particularly notable. However, individual hours may still see momentary price spikes.

**Sunday** stands out as clearly the most affordable day of the week. As a public holiday, electricity demand is typically lower. The average price will be just 0.5 cents, and the lowest hourly price will drop to –1.8 cents during the night and afternoon. The day's maximum price will reach up to 5.0 cents, but there is also a calculated risk for individual price spikes up to 10 cents on Sunday.

Overall, the coming week will offer mostly moderate electricity prices for users. Price fluctuation within each day will remain limited, and the most affordable moments will be during the night and afternoon of the public holiday. The most expensive hours will fall on Friday evening when wind power production is at its lowest.
