Next week, spot electricity price expectations will remain moderate, but there will be clear variations between days. **Sunday** stands out as the most affordable day, with an average price forecast of just 0.2 cents per kilowatt-hour, and the lowest prices even dipping into negative territory during night and afternoon hours. The abundant supply of wind power supports this low price level throughout the day.

**Monday** will be the most expensive day of the week, with the average electricity price expected to rise to 3.6 cents. Prices will fluctuate notably throughout the day, peaking at 7.1 cents during the early evening (between 8–10 pm). Wind power production will be lower than on other days, with the minimum dropping below 1,000 megawatts, which partly explains the higher maximum price. Monday also carries a forecasted risk of individual hourly price spikes, when the price could temporarily reach up to 10 cents per kilowatt-hour, especially during the early evening.

**On Tuesday**, electricity prices will decrease somewhat from Monday’s level. The average price will be 2.6 cents, with the highest hourly price reaching 4.7 cents. Tuesday also carries a possibility of single-hour price spikes, with prices potentially rising above the forecast, particularly during morning and evening hours.

**Wednesday** will see prices drop further: the average price will be 1.8 cents, with a maximum of 4.0 cents. The risk of price spikes remains, but otherwise, intraday price differences will be moderate.

In the latter part of the week, **Thursday** and **Friday** are expected to have similar price levels. On both days, the average price will be 2.4 cents. Thursday’s maximum price rises to 5.5 cents and Friday’s to 6.3 cents, with wind power production occasionally at low levels. Both days also have a forecasted risk that individual hourly prices could reach up to 10 cents per kilowatt-hour, especially during the morning and early evening.

**Saturday** will see price expectations fall again. The average price will be 1.3 cents and the maximum 2.3 cents. Although a weekend price spike risk is mentioned, the forecast suggests prices will otherwise remain steady throughout the day.

Overall, next week's electricity price forecasts will stay below four cents each day, and are well below this on most days. The most noticeable expensive hours will occur early in the week, especially on Monday evening, when low wind production pushes prices higher and the risk of individual price spikes is highlighted. As the week progresses, prices will stabilize and remain mostly low.
