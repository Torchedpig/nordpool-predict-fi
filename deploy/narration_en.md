The electricity price forecast for the coming week shows variable figures. The coming week will see both more expensive and cheaper days.

The average price of exchange electricity on **Monday** will be 13 cents per kilowatt-hour, and during the day the price will fluctuate from 4.4 cents up to 23.7 cents. Monday's highest price will be between nine and ten o'clock in the morning. Wind power production will be weak on Monday, which partly explains the higher price level.

On **Tuesday**, the average price of exchange electricity will fall to 9.6 cents. During the day, the price will fluctuate between 2.4 and 14.3 cents. However, it should be noted that there is a high risk of price spikes on Tuesday, with prices for individual hours rising to as much as 20-40 cents. The risk of a price spike is between eight and nine in the morning.

On **Wednesday**, the average price of exchange electricity will rise to 12.3 cents. The price will vary from 7.0 cents to 23.1 cents. A high risk of price spikes is also forecast for Wednesday, with prices for individual hours rising to as much as 30-50 cents. The price peak will be between eight and nine in the morning. Wednesday's price will be pushed up by low wind power production, which will be at its lowest at only 84 MW.

On **Thursday**, the average price of exchange electricity is expected to be 12.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. The price will fluctuate during the day from 6.5 cents to 17.3 cents. There is also a high risk of price spikes on Thursday, up to 30-50 cents in individual hours, most likely between eight and nine in the morning.

On **Friday**, the average price of exchange electricity will fall to 8.2 cents. During the day, the price will fluctuate between 2.4 and 17.4 cents. There is a high risk of price spikes forecast for Friday, as on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, with prices for individual hours rising to as much as 20-30 cents. The risk of a price spike is between eight and nine in the morning.

During the weekend, the price of exchange electricity will fall significantly. On **Saturday**, the average price will be only 3.1 cents and on **Sunday** 3.9 cents per kilowatt-hour. The low prices at the weekend are explained by strong wind power, with production exceeding 3000 megawatts on average on both days. The cheapest hours on Saturday will be in the afternoon between 3 and 5 PM, when the price will fall close to one cent.
