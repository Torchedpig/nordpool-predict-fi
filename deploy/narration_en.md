*Low and even negative electricity prices during the weekend will turn into a risk of price spikes and higher prices on Sunday and early next week, as wind power generation significantly decreases and the maintenance outage at Olkiluoto 3 continues.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is undergoing a maintenance outage. The outage began on March 1, 2025, at 03:00 and is expected to end on May 2, 2025, at 02:00. The maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as training data from periods of maintenance outages is limited.

The forecast was updated on Thursday at 12:00.

The upcoming week will see significant variation in electricity spot prices. On Friday and Saturday, electricity will remain affordable and even exceptionally cheap. On Saturday, the average price will dip slightly into negative territory, with the lowest price around midday between 11:00 and 13:00, when electricity will cost approximately -1.3 cents. Negative prices are due to strong wind power production, keeping the electricity market surplus high.

However, the price situation will change significantly on **Sunday**, when prices will rise notably. The day's average price will approach five cents, and during the evening hours between 19:00 and 21:00, electricity will cost over 11 cents. Sunday also carries a high risk of price spikes, with individual hourly prices potentially rising as high as 10â€“20 cents. The reason is very low wind power production, particularly later in the day, when minimum generation drops below one thousand megawatts.

The week's highest prices, however, will occur on **Monday**, when the daily average price will rise above 10 cents. Monday's peak price will occur in the morning between 8:00 and 10:00, when electricity prices may exceed 24 cents. Monday also carries a very high risk of price spikes, and hourly prices could reach as high as 30â€“40 cents. Prices are driven upward especially by exceptionally low wind power generation, which at its lowest point during the day is around 500 megawatts.

On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, prices will remain relatively high. Tuesday's average price will exceed seven cents, and Wednesday's nearly ten cents. The risk of price spikes remains high on both days: on Tuesday, hourly prices could rise to 20â€“30 cents, and on Wednesday as high as 20â€“40 cents. Toward the end of the week, the situation will calm down, and on **Thursday**, electricity prices will return to a relatively affordable level, averaging below four cents. Next **Friday**, prices will remain low and stable, around 1.8 cents throughout the day.
