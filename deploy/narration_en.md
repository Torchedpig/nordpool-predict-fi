*Electricity prices will remain generally low during the coming week, but Monday morning will see a brief spike above 11 cents due to weak wind power production. Sunday, on the other hand, will offer even negative prices, and prices will stabilize at moderate levels towards the end of the week.*

The Olkiluoto 1 nuclear power plant is undergoing maintenance, which began on 11.5.2025 at 18:00 and is estimated to end on 22.5.2025 at 18:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data from periods of outages is limited.

Electricity prices for the upcoming week are generally expected to be quite affordable, although clear differences between days are noticeable. A key day to observe is **Monday**, characterized by significant price volatility. While the day's average electricity price will be 2.2 cents, there will be an exceptionally high peak price of 11.2 cents, occurring between 7:00 and 9:00 in the morning. On the same day, wind power generation will drop to a notably low minimum level of 416 megawatts. This scarcity of wind production explains Monday's elevated maximum price.

During the weekend, prices will remain very low. On **Sunday**, the average electricity price will even turn negative, at -0.2 cents, with prices fluctuating between -1.7 cents and 1.3 cents. Such negative prices are unusual and typically occur at night or when wind power generation is exceptionally abundant relative to consumption.

On other weekdays, prices will fluctuate moderately, with daily averages clearly remaining below four cents. On **Friday**, the average electricity price will rise slightly to 2.7 cents but will remain affordable. Prices on Friday will be stable, with no significant fluctuations throughout the day.

The differences observed in wind power production within the week partly explain the price variations. Specifically, the weak wind production on **Monday** directly influences the day's price peak. Otherwise, wind production fluctuations will not cause significant price changes.

Overall, electricity prices will remain low next week. Notable exceptions are Monday morning's singular price spike and Sunday's negative nighttime prices. On other days, the electricity market will maintain a stable and affordable price level.
