*Electricity prices will remain mostly affordable in the upcoming week, but Thursday stands out with significantly higher prices and a notable risk of price spikes due to low wind power production.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is undergoing a maintenance break that started on 1.3.2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on 2.5.2025 at 02:00. This maintenance break may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data from periods of maintenance interruptions is limited.

Electricity prices during the upcoming week will show clear daily variations. The average price level will mostly remain affordable, around or below five cents, but **Thursday** clearly stands out as a significantly more expensive day. Thursday's expected daily average price is 8,8 cents, and price fluctuations within the day will be substantial.

On **Tuesday**, electricity prices will range extensively, from zero to nearly 15 cents. The highest prices will occur in the morning between 6â€“8, when the day's maximum price reaches 14,9 Â¢. On **Wednesday**, prices will drop again, with the daily average at just 2,3 cents. Wednesday's cheapest period will occur in the early morning hours, when prices may even become slightly negative.

On Thursday, electricity prices will rise significantly to the week's highest levels. The day's maximum price will reach up to 16,8 cents during the evening hours between 18â€“20, and the risk of price spikes is substantial. During individual hours, prices could rise considerably higher than forecast, even reaching levels of 20â€“40 cents. The reason for these high prices is clearly the notably low wind power production, which will reach a minimum of only around 518 MW.

On Friday and Saturday, price levels will again return to lower levels. On Friday, the daily average price is 3,6 cents, and on Saturday it will fall further to 2,7 cents. On Sunday, electricity prices will reach the week's lowest level, with an average of only 0,1 cents. Sunday will also see negative prices during the afternoon hours between 14â€“16.

At the beginning of next week, on Monday, the price level will remain very moderate. The daily average is forecast at 1,3 cents, and no significant fluctuations are expected throughout the day. Overall, the week will provide electricity at mostly affordable prices, but Thursday's price level will clearly deviate from other days of the week.
