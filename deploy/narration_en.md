*Electricity prices will show clear fluctuations in the coming days: the end of the week will be inexpensive, even dipping into negative prices, but prices will rise significantly at times on Thursday's public holiday and early next week. Wind conditions partly explain the variability, and the risk of price spikes remains considerable at times.*

Electricity prices will fluctuate notably depending on the day of the week. The largest variations will occur on **Thursday**, when the average price will slightly exceed five and a half cents. On that day, hourly prices may reach nearly 12 cents per kilowatt-hour. Thursday is a public holiday, which might lead to lower electricity demand than usual. Despite this, the risk of price spikes will remain high, and at worst, hourly prices could rise up to 20 cents per kilowatt-hour. Peak prices will occur during the morning between 7–9 am and again late in the evening between 10 pm and midnight.

The most affordable days of the week will be **Friday**, **Saturday**, and **Sunday**, with daily prices remaining very low. On Friday and Sunday nights, electricity prices will briefly fall below zero. The cheapest period will be on Friday between 2–4 am, when the price dips slightly negative.

Prices will rise again on **Monday**, with the daily average approaching six cents. Monday’s highest hourly price, 10,2 cents per kilowatt-hour, will occur in the evening between 5–7 pm. Prices will remain relatively high on Tuesday as well, with an average exceeding five cents. Tuesday will also carry a risk of price spikes, with hourly prices potentially rising up to 20 cents. Tuesday’s highest prices will occur late in the evening between 8–10 pm.

Next **Wednesday**, prices will slightly decrease but still maintain an average above four cents. Wednesday’s price fluctuations will remain moderate, but hourly price peaks may approach 10 cents per kilowatt-hour. The highest prices on Wednesday will occur between 8–10 am.

Wind power will at times be abundant during the week, explaining the low prices on Friday and over the weekend. Conversely, lower wind power production levels early in the week help explain the higher prices.
