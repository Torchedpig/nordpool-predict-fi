In the coming week, electricity exchange prices will vary clearly between days, with occasional sharp price spikes expected during certain hours. **Sunday** stands out as the most affordable day of the week, with an average price of just 0.2 cents per kilowatt hour and the lowest hourly price dropping to -0.2 cents. Electricity will be near zero for several hours, especially during the night and early morning. Abundant wind power production explains this low price level.

**Monday** brings a significant increase in price levels: the average price rises to 3.3 cents. According to the forecast, prices will fluctuate widely on Monday, and individual hours may see spikes up to 10 cents, especially in the morning from 7–9 and in the evening from 18–20. Wind power production drops below a thousand megawatts during these times, which explains the potential for price spikes.

**Tuesday** continues at a more moderate level, but there is still a risk of hourly prices rising to 10 cents, particularly in the morning from 8–10 and in the evening from 19–21. The average price remains at 2.6 cents. **Wednesday** holds the same average price as Tuesday, with a slightly lower maximum price, although spike risk is also forecasted for similar time periods.

In the latter part of the week, **Thursday** and **Friday** average prices rise somewhat higher, to 3.7–4.0 cents. On Thursday and Friday, minimum wind power production remains low, which according to the forecast increases maximum prices. On these days, the risk of price spikes exists especially in the morning from 8–10 and in the evening from 19–21, when individual hourly prices could approach 10 cents per kilowatt hour. On Saturday, the price level returns closer to the early week range, with the average price at 2.7 cents.

During the week, electricity prices will mostly remain moderate, but on several days there will be individual hours when prices may rise considerably higher than the forecasted maximum. Particularly, the morning and evening hours at the start and end of the week are expected to be most prone to price spikes, related to strong fluctuations in wind power production during these periods.
