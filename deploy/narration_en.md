The coming week will see varying electricity prices. Early in the week, price levels will be notably higher compared to the rest of the week. On **Monday**, the day's average price is forecasted to reach 12.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, with peak prices expected near 20 cents. Monday carries a significant risk of price spikes, potentially reaching up to 50 cents per hour. High prices are anticipated particularly during late morning hours between 10:00‚Äì12:00.

Similarly, the first **Sunday** of the week will show considerable price fluctuations. Throughout the day, electricity prices will vary widely, from near-zero levels to around 15.5 cents at their highest. Sunday also has a notable risk of price spikes, with hourly prices potentially rising up to 30 cents. Evening hours between 19:00‚Äì21:00 will be the most expensive.

On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, prices will noticeably drop from Monday's levels, settling around five cents on average. The risk of price spikes will be lower on these days, though hourly prices could still reach up to 10 cents at certain times. Early morning hours on Tuesday, between 04:00‚Äì06:00, will have exceptionally low electricity prices, just slightly above one cent.

The week's cheapest days will be **Thursday** and **Friday**. On Thursday, the average price will fall below two cents, and on Friday even below half a cent. Additionally, these days will see negative prices‚Äîespecially Thursday afternoon between 14:00‚Äì16:00, when the price will drop as low as -1.4 cents. This means consumers will receive a small payment for electricity consumed during those hours.

On Saturday, prices will rise slightly compared to Thursday and Friday but remain moderate. On Sunday, prices will return to a moderate level around seven cents, but again, there is a noticeable risk of price spikes, potentially up to 20 cents during certain hours.

This week coincides with the Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant's maintenance outage, which may increase uncertainty in price forecasts.
