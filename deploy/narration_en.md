This week's electricity price forecast emphasizes **Wednesday**, which will see the week's highest expected prices. According to the forecast, Wednesday's average price will rise to 7,7 cents per kilowatt-hour. Prices within the day will fluctuate significantly, potentially exceeding 15 cents around 8 a.m. (from 7‚Äì9). There is a notable risk of price spikes on Wednesday, with individual hourly prices possibly rising as high as 20‚Äì30 cents. This is partly explained by the low wind power production, which will drop below 700 megawatts at its lowest point.

Other weekdays will be considerably more stable and affordable. On **Monday**, the average price will settle around 2,6 cents, with the day's peak prices occurring in the evening between 6‚Äì8 p.m. On **Tuesday**, prices will remain mostly moderate, but during the evening peak hours of 6‚Äì8 p.m., prices will rise slightly above 11 cents. Negative prices will also appear early Tuesday morning, dropping as low as -1,5 cents.

On **Thursday** and **Friday**, prices will remain moderate, with average prices below four cents. No significant price peaks are expected during these days, with the price range staying between approximately one and seven cents. Wind power production on Thursday will be abundant, averaging over 3500 MW, which partly helps maintain low prices.

**Saturday** will see electricity prices occasionally turning negative again, dropping as low as -0,3 cents. Throughout the day, prices will remain very affordable, but there is a risk of momentary price spikes that may reach up to 10 cents. On Sunday, price development will also remain stable and moderate, with no significant fluctuations expected.

Next **Monday**, the price forecast is stable, with the day's average price staying at 2,4 cents without notable fluctuations. Overall, the week will be mostly moderate regarding prices, with the exception of Wednesday's unusually high price levels.
