The price of exchange electricity will rise in the coming week. Price expectations are moderate at the beginning of the week, but on **Wednesday** the price will increase significantly. The average price for Wednesday is forecast at 10.3 ¢, and the highest price of the day could rise to 16.5 cents per kilowatt-hour.

On Wednesday and Thursday, wind power is forecast to be weak, which partly explains the rise in prices. In the hourly forecast for Wednesday, wind power production will fall to just over a thousand megawatts at its lowest. There is also a high risk of price spikes forecast for Wednesday. Prices for individual hours could rise to as much as 30-40 cents per kilowatt-hour.

Next **Thursday**, the price will continue to rise. The average price for the day is expected to be 12.6 ¢, and the highest price of the day could rise to 21.2 cents. Wind power is also expected to be scarce on Thursday, which is likely to keep prices high. Similar to Wednesday, a high risk of price spikes is forecast for Thursday, up to 50 cents per kilowatt-hour for individual hours. According to the hourly forecast, the price spike would be in the early evening, around 5-7 PM.

On **Friday** and next **Saturday**, the price of electricity will remain high. The average price for Friday is expected to be 12.7 ¢ and for Saturday 11.8 ¢. The highest price on Friday could rise to 18.2 cents and on Saturday to 19.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. Both days also have a high risk of price spikes, up to 50 cents for individual hours. On Friday, the risk of a price spike is highest in the morning, around 8-10 AM. On Saturday, the spike would be in the evening, around 5-7 PM. On Friday and Saturday, the frost will also tighten, which will increase electricity consumption.

In addition to low wind power, the week's highest prices are therefore also explained by the colder weather. The average temperature on Saturday is forecast to be -7.1 degrees Celsius. As large differences in intra-day prices are expected in the coming days, electricity users should follow the hourly forecasts and time their consumption to the cheapest hours.
