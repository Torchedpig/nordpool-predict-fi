The price of exchange electricity will be mostly affordable in the coming week. Price expectations will vary somewhat during the week, and the most expensive days will be at the beginning of the week.

On **Monday**, the average price of electricity will rise to 4.8 cents, and the highest price of the day could rise to 10.9 cents per kilowatt-hour. Monday's average price will be the highest of the week. Less wind power will be available on Monday than on other days, at its lowest, less than 2000 megawatts.

On **Tuesday**, the price will turn downwards again, and the average price for the day is predicted to be 1.6 Â¢. Between Tuesday and Wednesday night, the price of electricity will even fall into negative territory, at its lowest -0.8 cents.

On **Wednesday**, the average price of electricity will be only 1.2 Â¢ per kilowatt-hour. Wednesday's price is very close to Sunday's price level. Between Wednesday and Thursday night, the price will drop to -1.2 cents.

Towards the end of the week, the price of electricity will rise slightly. On **Thursday**, the average price will be 4.8 Â¢, and on Friday and Saturday, it will be at the level of 2.5-2.6 cents. There will be plenty of wind power available at the end of the week, which should keep prices reasonable. On Thursday, however, the price of electricity could temporarily rise to 8.1 cents.
