Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is undergoing a maintenance outage, which began on 01.03.2025 at 03:00 and is scheduled to end on 02.05.2025 at 02:00. This outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data during maintenance outages is limited.

The electricity price outlook for the coming week will generally be affordable. Daily average prices will range from Sunday's 0.2 cents to Tuesday's 4.0 cents per kilowatt-hour. Prices will remain mostly low, and negative hourly prices will occur each day. This means electricity consumers may even get paid for their consumption at certain times during the night or early morning hours.

The week's cheapest day will be **Sunday**, with an average price of only 0.2 Â¢. On Sunday, prices will dip into negative territory particularly in the evening around 18â€“20 hrs, reaching as low as -1.6 Â¢. Sunday's highest price will occur in the morning around 8â€“9 hrs, peaking at 2.1 Â¢.

The most expensive day will be **Tuesday**, with an average price reaching four cents. Tuesday will also experience the week's highest single hourly price, 8.4 cents, around 20â€“22 hrs in the evening. Additionally, Tuesday has been flagged for a potential risk of price spikes, meaning that individual hourly prices may be up to 10 Â¢ higher than the maximum price listed in the table.

Other days, such as **Monday** and **Friday**, will be slightly more affordable than Tuesday, averaging around two to three cents. These days will also feature negative hourly prices, especially during night and early morning hours. The highest prices typically occur in the eveningâ€”for example, on Friday between 20â€“22 hrs, electricity will cost up to 9.2 Â¢.

Midweek days, **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, will again see moderate prices, averaging only 1.3 Â¢ each day. Both these days will have negative hourly prices, particularly during nighttime and early morning hours.
