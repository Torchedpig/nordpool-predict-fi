The price forecast for exchange electricity for the coming week looks volatile. Both more expensive and cheaper days are expected.

On **Monday**, the average price of electricity will settle at 12.8 Â¢/kWh, and the intraday variation is large, from 4.7 cents to as much as 18.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. Monday's maximum price will likely be during the morning hours between 8-10. Only a little wind power is forecast for Monday, at its lowest only 659 MW, which partly explains the high price. In addition, there is a high risk of price spikes on Monday, with prices for individual hours potentially rising as high as 30-50 cents.

Next **Tuesday**, the average price of electricity will be 9.7 Â¢/kWh, but on Tuesday, too, the price can vary from 3.2 cents to 14.5 cents. A high risk of price spikes is also forecast for Tuesday: prices for individual hours can rise as high as 20-40 cents.

On **Wednesday**, the average price of electricity will fall to 8.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. The price will vary between 2.7 and 13.5 cents during Wednesday. On Wednesday, too, there is a risk that prices for individual hours will rise as high as 20 cents.

**Thursday**'s average price will rise to 11.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. The price can vary between 5.2 and 17.9 cents during Thursday. Thursday's maximum price is likely to occur during the morning hours between 7-9. More wind power is available on Thursday than on Monday, but even on Thursday, there is a high risk of price spikes, up to 30-40 cents per kilowatt-hour.

On **Friday**, the price of electricity will fall significantly. The average price will be 4.6 Â¢/kWh, and the price will vary during the day between 3.0 and 8.0 cents. On Friday, there will be plenty of wind power, which explains the cheaper price.

During the weekend, the price of electricity will fall further. On **Saturday**, the average price will be only 2.2 Â¢/kWh, and the price will fall to as low as -1.0 cents during the day. On Saturday, there will be a very large supply of wind power, which explains the low price.

Next **Sunday**, the price will rise again, and the average price will be 7.9 Â¢/kWh. On Sunday, the price can vary from 0.3 cents to 13.1 cents. On Sunday, there is a high risk of price spikes, with prices for individual hours potentially rising as high as 20-30 cents.
