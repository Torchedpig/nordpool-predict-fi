*Next week’s electricity price outlook in Finland shows clear variation by day and wind power production. From Wednesday to Friday, the risk of price spikes increases, but as the weekend approaches, significantly lower electricity prices are expected.*

Loviisa nuclear power plant’s Unit 2 is undergoing a maintenance outage starting May 4, 2025 at 5:00 PM, with the work expected to be completed by May 7, 2025 at 12:00 PM. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of price forecasts, as there is limited training data available for such periods.

The forecast was updated on Tuesday at 21:06.

The electricity price forecasts for the coming week show noticeable differences between the days. **On Wednesday**, the highest average price of the week is expected at 8.8 cents, with a single hour potentially reaching up to 20.2 cents. This price peak is projected for the evening between 20:00 and 22:00. The minimum wind power production for the day is around 1,500 megawatts, which, together with low output, explains the high maximum price. Forecast models also estimate a significant risk of individual price spikes on days like Thursday and Friday, where the price for single hours could rise as high as 20 cents. On Thursday and Friday, average wind power production remains at a low level, well below 1,000 megawatts, increasing the likelihood of price spikes.

**On Thursday** and **Friday**, the average electricity price drops from the previous day, but the risk of price spikes persists. Thursday’s minimum wind output drops to 375 megawatts during the early morning, which, combined with potentially weak winds, could push single-hour prices significantly higher than forecasted. On Friday, the wind power minimum dips to just 271 megawatts, especially during the morning hours, and while the forecasted price ceiling is about 8.6 cents, the spike risk means some hours could be considerably more expensive.

As the weekend approaches, price forecasts decrease markedly. **Saturday** and **Sunday** show low average electricity prices, with Sunday reaching the week’s lowest average at just 2.7 cents. Sunday is also a public holiday, which typically means lower electricity demand compared to weekdays. This is reflected in both the low average price and the nearly zero lowest hourly price in the afternoon between 14:00 and 16:00. Wind power on Saturday and Sunday remains moderate, with no particularly low or high values.

The new week begins on Monday with moderate price levels. **Monday** and **Tuesday** both see average prices clearly below five cents. Especially on Tuesday, wind power production occasionally exceeds 3,000 megawatts, supporting low prices. The day’s average drops to 2.3 cents, and during certain hours, prices fall below half a cent.

The most expensive moments of the week are projected for the start of the week, particularly on Wednesday evening and during the morning and evening hours of Thursday and Friday, when the risk of price spikes is highest. The cheapest electricity is expected on Sunday and Tuesday, especially from afternoon to evening, when prices may drop very close to zero.
