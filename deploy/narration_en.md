The price forecast for exchange electricity for the coming week shows a volatile picture. Prices will be, on average, high at the beginning of the week, but will fall significantly towards the end of the week. The most expensive days will be at the beginning of the week.

On **Tuesday**, the average price of exchange electricity is expected to settle at 12.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. During the day, however, the price will vary significantly, from a low of 3.2 cents to a high of 22.1 cents. The highest price is likely to be in the evening, around 18:00-20:00. Tuesday's average temperature is expected to be -2.8 degrees Celsius, which may partly explain the higher prices.

On **Wednesday**, the price of electricity will rise further, with an average price of 15.8 Â¢/kWh expected for the day. The price will vary between 9.5 cents and 21.1 cents. On Wednesday, wind power production will remain at a very low level, only 57-744 MW, which is likely to increase the price. Wednesday also carries a high risk of price spikes, with prices for individual hours potentially rising as high as 40-60 cents. Price spikes are likely to occur in the morning around 7:00-9:00 or in the evening around 17:00-19:00. Cold weather, with an average temperature of -4.3 degrees, can also have an upward effect on prices.

On **Thursday**, the average price of exchange electricity will remain high, at 13.0 cents per kilowatt-hour. The price will vary between 4.4 cents and 18.5 cents. Wind power production will increase from Wednesday, but will still be low at times, which may affect the price. Thursday also carries a high risk of price spikes, with prices for individual hours potentially rising as high as 30-50 cents. Price spikes are likely to occur in the morning, around 7:00-9:00, or in the evening, around 17:00-19:00. Cold weather may partly affect the price.

Towards the end of the week, the price of electricity will turn sharply downwards. On **Friday**, the average price will be only 4.9 Â¢, and the price will vary between 2.3 cents and 9.7 cents. On **Saturday**, the average price will be 4.7 Â¢, and the price will vary between 1.7 cents and 8.5 cents. On **Sunday**, exchange electricity will already be very cheap, with an average price of only 3.0 Â¢. On Sunday, electricity will be at its cheapest at only 0.8 Â¢/kWh, most likely during the early morning hours.

Next **Monday**, the price of electricity will still be at an affordable level, with an average price of 5.2 Â¢ per kilowatt-hour.
