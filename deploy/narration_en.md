*The coming week on the electricity market will see significant price fluctuations: after high prices and morning price peaks early in the week, rates will fall distinctly from Wednesday into the weekend, dropping at times even into negative territory due to strong wind production.*

Electricity prices in the coming week will vary considerably from day to day. **Monday** stands out most, with the average electricity price rising to around 9.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. Prices will fluctuate strongly within the day: during the morning between 8‚Äì10 am, prices will exceed 20 cents, peaking around 9 am at as high as 25 cents per kilowatt-hour. The risk of price spikes on Monday morning is clearly elevated, especially since wind production will be at its lowest during these hours, falling below 200 megawatts.

On **Tuesday**, the price situation will calm somewhat, as the average price drops below five cents. However, prices are expected to peak between 8‚Äì10 am, reaching around 10‚Äì14 cents per kilowatt-hour. Tuesday also carries an increased risk of individual hourly price spikes during the morning.

On **Sunday**, the electricity price will remain below four cents per kilowatt-hour on average, but individual higher prices will be observed between 6‚Äì8 am, exceeding seven cents. Sunday is a public holiday, which may lower overall energy demand and thereby influence prices downward.

Starting from Wednesday, electricity prices will fall distinctly. On **Wednesday**, **Thursday**, **Friday**, and **Saturday**, prices will remain economical, averaging less than two cents per kilowatt-hour, with negative electricity prices occurring on each of these days. Wednesday's prices will fall as low as -1.0 cents, with Thursday and Saturday seeing even lower rates, down to -1.7 and -0.9 cents respectively. These days are forecasted to have strong winds, explaining the very low electricity prices.

In the latter half of the week, electricity price fluctuations will level out markedly compared to early in the week, with no price spikes expected. Average temperatures throughout the week will be cool but not unusual for the time of year.
