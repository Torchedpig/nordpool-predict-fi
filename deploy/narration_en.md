*Electricity prices on the power exchange will remain predominantly low throughout the coming week, with negative prices even expected on Sunday. Occasional price spikes are anticipated during the weekend and the holiday on Thursday, but overall, the price development will be favorable for consumers.*

There is a production shortfall at the Olkiluoto 1 nuclear power plant, which began on 22 May 2025 at 09:00 and is forecasted to end on the same day at 23:00. Available power output during this period is just 50 MW, representing a 5.6 percent capacity utilization of the plant's normal 890 MW nominal power. The maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of price forecasts, as training data from outage periods is limited.

The forecast was last updated on Thursday at 09:41.

Price forecasts for the coming days indicate generally moderate electricity prices. Average exchange prices will remain below two cents per kilowatt-hour throughout the week, creating favorable conditions for consumers.

The highest expected daily average price this week will occur on **Friday**, reaching 1.6 cents per kilowatt-hour, with hourly prices fluctuating from near zero up to 4.6 cents. This 4.6-cent peak, the highest hourly price of the week, is expected in the morning between 07:00 and 09:00. Friday's price range is the widest compared to other days.

During the **weekend**, prices will become even lower. **Saturday** will see an average price of 1.3 cents, and on **Sunday**, it's only 0.4 cents. Sunday will feature the week's lowest electricity prices, with negative prices as low as -1.7 cents between 14:00 and 16:00. However, there is a risk of occasional hourly price spikes on Sunday, when prices could temporarily rise significantly.

On **Monday** and **Tuesday**, prices will remain extremely low, averaging less than half a cent. **Tuesday** will record the week's lowest average price at just 0.1 cents, with no significant risk of price spikes projected.

**Thursday** is a public holiday, reducing electricity demand compared to regular weekdays. The day's average price will be only 0.6 cents, although isolated price spikes up to 4.5 cents may occur in the evening hours between 19:00 and 21:00.

Overall, the price outlook for the coming days promises affordable electricity for consumers. Occasional price spikes may appear during specific hours, particularly over the weekend and on the holiday. Price fluctuations will be significantly influenced by variations in wind power production; for instance, extremely low wind production on Sunday morning partly explains the higher hourly prices observed then.
