*Electricity market prices are expected to remain mostly moderate in the coming week, with the cheapest hours occurring over the weekend and at night. Later in the week, a drop in wind power production may, however, push individual hourly prices clearly higher than at the start of the week.*

The electricity market over the weekend is expected to remain unusually affordable, with **Friday** and **Saturday** averaging well below one cent per kilowatt-hour. On **Sunday**, the price will also remain low, with no individual high hourly prices visible in the forecast. On several hours during the weekend, prices may briefly drop into negative territory, especially at night and in the early morning hours. This is influenced by strong wind power production, which remains at a high level throughout the weekend.

At the start of the week, price expectations change. **Monday** sees the average price rise to about two cents per kilowatt-hour, and intra-day fluctuations increase: in the morning and evening, hourly prices are expected to reach 4–4.5 cents. At the same time, wind power production will be somewhat lower than during the weekend, partly explaining the price increase.

Next **Tuesday**, the electricity price settles at an average of 1.6 cents. Some variability is again seen during the day: in the early morning hours, prices may turn negative, but in the evening, they rise above four cents. Variations in wind power production are reflected especially in the daily minimum and maximum values.

On **Wednesday**, wind power production will be close to a low level, which slightly raises the day's average price to 1.3 cents. Price fluctuations within the day remain moderate, and no individual high hourly prices are expected.

Next **Thursday** brings a clear exception in electricity prices: during the day, wind power production dips particularly low, at times dropping below 1,400 megawatts. For this reason, hourly price expectations climb to 4.6 cents, and the risk of price spikes is higher than usual. According to the forecast, in some hours the price of electricity could rise even to 10 cents if wind power production falls below expectations.

Overall, the coming week is expected to be affordable in terms of price level, but Thursday's potential price peaks stand out from the other days. A clear shift to slightly higher prices is seen between the start of the week and the weekend, but the cheapest hours will still occur overnight and during weekend days.
