*Electricity exchange prices will remain mostly affordable during the upcoming week, but Tuesday and Friday will experience notable price peaks due to low wind power production; on Friday's public holiday, spikes could exceed 10 cents.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is undergoing maintenance, which started on 01.03.2025 at 03:00 and is estimated to end on 02.05.2025 at 02:00. This maintenance break may affect the accuracy of forecasts because training data from maintenance periods is limited.

The electricity price forecast has been updated on Saturday at 03:13.

In the coming week, electricity exchange prices will fluctuate, but average daily prices are expected to remain mostly affordable. On **Sunday** and **Monday**, average prices will stay below two cents per kilowatt-hour, with both days also experiencing negative minimum prices. The cheapest hours will occur on Sunday afternoon between 15:00‚Äì17:00, when prices drop to -0,7 cents.

The highest average prices of the week are expected on **Tuesday** and **Friday**, when averages rise close to five cents. On both of these days, wind power generation will remain below average, partly explaining the higher prices. On Tuesday, prices will reach up to nine cents in the morning between 08:00‚Äì10:00. Additionally, there is a risk of short-term price spikes on Tuesday, potentially reaching up to 10 cents for certain hours.

**Friday** is a public holiday, which might reduce electricity demand and thus lower prices. However, wind power production will be extremely low, with minimum generation dropping below 800 megawatts. This will push Friday's maximum price to the week's highest level, exceeding 11 cents in the morning between 08:00‚Äì10:00. There is also a high risk of price spikes on Friday, with peak prices potentially momentarily reaching 10‚Äì20 cents for certain hours.

On **Thursday**, the average price will slightly exceed three cents, with prices peaking above eight cents in the morning between 08:00‚Äì10:00. Other days, such as **Wednesday** and **Saturday**, will be calmer with moderate average prices. On Saturday, maximum prices will remain below four cents, although there is still a risk of short-term higher prices.

Overall, next week's price forecast appears affordable, but individual days, particularly Tuesday and Friday, stand out due to significantly higher peak prices. The strong variability in wind power generation throughout the week will notably influence price fluctuations.
