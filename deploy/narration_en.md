The price of exchange electricity is expected to vary during the coming week. Next **Monday**, the price will rise significantly higher than on other days. Monday's average price will be 11.8 ¢/kWh, and within the day, the price may vary from 3.9 cents to as much as 20.4 cents per kilowatt-hour.

Significant variations in wind power production are also expected on Monday. According to the forecast, wind power will be available at a minimum of only 911 MW, while at its peak, production may rise to 3268 MW. This may partly explain the large price differences within the day. In addition, a hard frost of -8.0 degrees is forecast for Monday, which will increase the demand for electricity and raise the price. There is a high risk of price spikes on Monday, and the prices of individual hours can rise to as much as 30-50 cents per kilowatt-hour. The price spike is likely to occur in the early evening, around 6-8 PM.

On **Thursday**, the average price of exchange electricity will rise to 8.9 cents, and the price will vary from 3.5 cents to 20.6 cents. On Thursday, too, wind power production will remain low, at a minimum of only 1373 MW. The scarcity of wind power and the average temperature of -3.6 degrees may explain Thursday's higher price level. There is also a high risk of price spikes forecast for Thursday, with prices for individual hours potentially rising to as much as 20-40 cents. The most likely time for high prices will be in the evening, around 7-9 PM.

On **Friday**, a slightly lower average price than Thursday is expected, 8.1 ¢/kWh, but even then there is a risk that the prices of individual hours will rise up to 20 cents.

On other days, the price of exchange electricity is expected to settle at an average of 5-7 cents per kilowatt-hour. The price expectations for **Tuesday**, **Wednesday**, **Saturday** and **Sunday** are close to each other. Saturday and Sunday will have a hard frost, but electricity consumption is typically lower on weekends, which will balance the price. Sunday's average price, 5.1 ¢, will be the cheapest of the week. Wind power will be abundantly available during the weekend, which will lower the price.
