Electricity prices will vary considerably this week. **Friday** and **Saturday** will be the most affordable days on average, with prices staying below two cents per kilowatt hour. On Saturday, the lowest price will even be negative at -1.3 cents around midday from 13:00 to 15:00, meaning momentary negative electricity prices.

On **Tuesday**, prices will fluctuate widely from a nightly low of -1.2 cents to an evening peak of 9.8 cents, although the daily average remains moderate at around three cents. The situation will change on **Wednesday**, as the average price rises to 8.5 cents. In the morning between 08:00 and 10:00, prices will peak at nearly 16 cents. Wednesday also carries a high risk of further price spikes, potentially pushing hourly rates as high as 20-30 cents during morning hours.

On Thursday, prices will stabilize again at a low level, with an average of 2.4 cents. Abundant wind power availability will support low prices throughout the day. Prices will continue declining on Friday, making it the week's second most affordable day, with an average below two cents.

On Sunday, electricity prices will rise again with an average above six cents. Sunday evening between 20:00 and 22:00 might see individual hourly prices spike up to 20 cents, as the risk of price spikes is elevated. Limited wind power availability on Sunday will support higher prices.

The most expensive day of the week will be **Monday**, with an average electricity price exceeding 10 cents per kilowatt hour. On Monday morning, between 07:00 and 09:00, prices may surge up to 30-40 cents due to particularly low wind power availability causing upward price pressure.

Next Tuesday also shows potential for individual price spikes of up to 20 cents, although the day's forecast is otherwise stable, averaging 5.4 cents.
