*'The price of electricity on the power exchange will remain reasonable on most days, but a clear upward dip is expected at the beginning of the week. For Monday and Tuesday, a risk of price spikes many times higher than the daily maximum price is predicted. At that time, it is worth being careful with electricity consumption.'*

In the coming week, the price of electricity on the power exchange will fluctuate, and price expectations are, on average, higher than usual. The average price for the week is expected to settle at just under 9 cents per kilowatt-hour, while variations will be seen between individual days.

On **Wednesday**, the average price of electricity is expected to be around 7.2 ¢/kWh. The price will fluctuate between 0.6 and 12.2 cents. During the night between Wednesday and Thursday, the price will drop close to zero.

**Thursday** will be one of the cheapest days of the week, with the average price remaining at 6.5 cents. On Friday, the average price will rise to 8.3 cents, but will fall back below 7 cents on **Saturday**. **Sunday** will be the cheapest day of the weekend with an average price of 6.4 cents. On Saturday and Sunday, there will be a very abundant supply of wind power, which will contribute to keeping prices moderate. However, freezing temperatures may increase prices.

Next **Monday**, the average price of electricity will rise to over 10 cents. The daily variation on Monday and Tuesday will be large, as at its cheapest, electricity will cost less than 5 cents, but at its most expensive, the price will rise close to 18 cents. Next **Tuesday**, the average price will climb close to 12 cents, and the intraday variation will be even greater than on Monday. Tuesday will clearly be the most expensive day of the week.

During the coming weekend and early next week, the weather is expected to get colder, and the average temperature for the week will remain several degrees below zero. A significant risk of price spikes is expected on Monday and Tuesday. On individual hours, prices could rise as high as 30-40 cents on Monday and 30-50 cents on Tuesday, especially in the afternoon and early evening. On Tuesday, wind power is forecast to be weak, which partly explains the higher price risk.
