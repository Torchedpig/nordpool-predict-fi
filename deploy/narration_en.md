*This week's electricity prices will fluctuate significantly: prices will peak on Thursday and Friday due to low wind power production, drop close to zero over the weekend, and the maintenance outage at Olkiluoto 3 may affect forecast accuracy.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant will be undergoing a maintenance outage. The outage began on 1 March 2025 at 03:00 and is forecasted to end on 2 May 2025 at 02:00. The maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of forecasts, as training data from periods of nuclear outages is limited.

Forecast was updated on Tuesday at 14:19.

This week's electricity price forecast will show significant variation between the days. Average daily prices will range from less than one cent up to over nine cents per kilowatt-hour. Intra-day price fluctuations will also be considerable, especially towards the middle of the week.

The highest average daily price of the week will occur on **Thursday**, estimated at 9.4 cents. Thursday's maximum hourly price will reach 16.1 cents, occurring between 18:00 and 20:00 in the evening. Additionally, on Thursday there will be a particular risk of price spikes above the forecasted maximum: in individual hours, electricity prices may rise to as high as 20‚Äì40 cents. This is due to very low wind power production, with minimum output at only 365 MW.

On **Friday**, electricity prices will also remain relatively high, with an average of 7.6 cents. Friday's highest forecasted hourly price is 14.9 cents, expected between 6:00 and 8:00 in the morning. Wind power generation on Friday will remain at low levels, dipping to as low as 342 MW, partially explaining the high maximum price. Additionally, Friday has a risk of individual hourly price spikes reaching 20‚Äì30 cents.

Over the weekend, electricity prices will clearly decrease. On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, prices will remain low, averaging around one cent. On Saturday, electricity prices will even become negative during nighttime hours, reaching as low as -0.4 cents. Sunday prices will remain low and stable throughout the day, peaking at only 1.9 cents.

At the beginning of next week, prices will rise slightly but remain relatively affordable. **Monday's** average price will be 2.9 cents, while **Tuesday's** will be 5.0 cents. On Tuesday afternoon between 14:00 and 16:00, electricity prices may briefly dip into negative territory, but in the morning between 6:00 and 8:00, a brief peak of 11 cents is expected. Additionally, Tuesday carries a risk of individual hourly price spikes of up to 10 cents.
