Electricity prices in the upcoming week will vary considerably, but overall, average prices will remain quite affordable. Daily average prices will stay consistently below four cents throughout the week, and no single day stands out as particularly expensive.

The week's cheapest day will be **Sunday**, when the average price will drop to just 0,1 cents per kilowatt-hour. Sunday will also see the week's lowest hourly prices, with electricity prices turning negative in the afternoon and evening. At its lowest, electricity will be available at -1,9 cents between 15:00 and 17:00.

The most expensive hours of the week will occur on **Friday** evening between 20:00 and 22:00, when prices will exceed eight cents. Similarly, on **Tuesday** morning between 8:00 and 10:00, prices will rise beyond the eight-cent mark. However, these higher hourly prices will not significantly raise the daily average, as prices will remain low overall on both days.

The low average prices can be partly explained by abundant wind power production, which will remain high throughout the week. On each day, average wind power production will exceed 3000 megawatts, contributing to the low price levels.

There will be no notable temperature fluctuations during the week, and temperature will not affect electricity prices. No risk of price spikes has been identified for any day.
