Electricity prices for the weekend are expected to remain low. **On Saturday**, the average price is projected to be just 0.1 cents, with slightly negative hourly prices during the morning and afternoon hours. **Sundayâ€™s** average price remains very low at 0.2 cents, dipping as low as minus half a cent, especially in the early morning and late morning hours.

As the week begins, price levels are set to rise. **Monday** will see the average price climb to 2.5 cents, with a broader range from negative hours up to 4.6 cents. **Tuesday** continues this pattern: the average price is expected at 2.2 cents, with the dayâ€™s highest price reaching 5.2 cents between 8â€“10 a.m., coinciding with the lowest wind power output. **Wednesday**â€™s prices remain moderate, with the average at 1.3 cents and a maximum of 3.2 cents.

Toward the end of the week, attention turns to Thursday and Friday, when isolated price spikes are forecast for some hours. **Thursdayâ€™s** prices range from â€“0.8 cents to 5.2 cents, but model predictions suggest some hours may climb as high as 10 cents, particularly between 8â€“10 a.m. and 9â€“11 p.m. **Friday** is expected to see the weekâ€™s highest average price, 3.4 cents, and a maximum of 6.8 cents between 9â€“11 p.m. Here, too, uncertainty is considerable, as hourly prices could reach up to 10 cents, especially in the evening.

The weekâ€™s most expensive hours are expected on Friday and Thursday evenings, coinciding with the lowest wind power output, which drops to just 1,138 megawatts on Friday. At these times, hourly electricity prices may temporarily exceed the rest of the weekâ€™s levels. On other days, the price remains clearly lower, and especially the abundant wind power over the weekend keeps prices very low, even negative during some morning and afternoon hours.

Overall, the week is characterized by significant swings between cheap and clearly higher hourly prices, but average prices remain well below 5 cents throughout. Fluctuations in wind power output are the main factor behind these price changes, reflected in both low and occasionally high prices.
