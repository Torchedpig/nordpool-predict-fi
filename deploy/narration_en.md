In the upcoming week, electricity prices on the spot market will remain very low on average. However, clear differences will occur, particularly on **Friday**, when the average price rises to the week's highest level at approximately 2.6 cents. Friday will also see the week's most expensive individual hour, with prices peaking at over 8 cents around 9 a.m.

The early days of the week (**Monday** and **Tuesday**) and also **Wednesday** are exceptionally affordable. During these days, prices are expected to remain close to zero or slightly below. Negative electricity prices will also appear on Monday and Tuesday, reaching as low as -1.3 cents on Tuesday afternoon between 1–3 p.m.

On **Thursday**, which is a public holiday, electricity demand is likely to be lower than usual. This could help maintain low prices. However, Thursday's average price (1.3 ¢) is higher than the early week's pricing, and there is a risk of individual hourly price spikes during the day. The most expensive hour on Thursday will occur between 6–8 p.m., when the price may climb up to 4 cents.

The weekend starts again on **Saturday** with very affordable prices, including negative pricing in the early morning hours, reaching down to -1.0 cents around 6–8 a.m. Saturday's average price is only around 0.1 cents, closely matching the very low prices of the early week.

Overall, the coming week will offer electricity consumers affordable hours throughout. However, price fluctuations should be noted, especially on Friday and some individual hours on Thursday evening.
