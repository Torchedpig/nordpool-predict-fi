During the coming week, electricity prices will remain generally affordable. Overnight prices will frequently turn negative, reaching as low as below -1,5 cents on Sunday and Thursday. However, price differences between individual days will be quite notable, and after mid-week, the price level will slightly rise.

The early days of the week will be the cheapest. Average prices on **Monday** and **Tuesday** will stay close to zero. Tuesday night will even see prices as low as -1,2 cents. Strong wind power production will help keep prices low, especially on Monday, when average wind power generation will reach almost 3900 megawatts.

Starting from Wednesday, prices will begin to rise. **Thursday** is a public holiday, typically reducing electricity demand and potentially lowering prices. Nevertheless, Thursday’s highest price, 5,8 cents, will occur in the evening between 18:00–20:00, coinciding with the lowest wind power production of the week, slightly above 1000 megawatts. This may explain the price peak.

On **Friday**, prices will reach the week's highest level, with a maximum price of 8,1 cents occurring in the evening between 18:00–20:00. This is partly due to low wind production, which will dip below 1400 megawatts at its lowest point. Similarly, Saturday and Sunday may also see individual high-price spikes, although average weekend prices will remain moderate.

Saturday’s average price will be the week's lowest at a negative -0,3 cents. Throughout the day, prices will remain negative almost continuously, except for the evening hours. On Sunday, however, prices will fluctuate more strongly, and between 20:00–22:00 prices might exceed around 4 cents.

Overall, the week's price outlook will be varied, but average prices will remain affordable across the board. Individual hours, however, may rise significantly above average due to the risk of price spikes later in the week.
