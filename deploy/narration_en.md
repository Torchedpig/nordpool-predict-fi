In the coming week, there will be significant differences in the price expectations of electricity on the power exchange between different days. Next **Monday**, the price of electricity will be cheap, with an average price of only one cent per kilowatt-hour. Monday's hourly prices will vary between zero and 1.8 cents. On Tuesday, the average price will rise, but will still be below five cents.

Next **Wednesday**, the average price of electricity on the power exchange will rise significantly higher, to 10.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. Wednesday's price forecast ranges from 5.1 cents to 16 cents. Wednesday also has a high risk of price spikes, with individual hours potentially seeing prices rise as high as 30-40 cents. The most likely time for price spikes is between 7-9 am.

Next **Thursday**, the average price will fall slightly from Wednesday, to 8.8 ¢/kWh. Thursday's forecast maximum price is 14.7 ¢, but Thursday also carries a risk of price spikes, with individual hours potentially seeing prices rise as high as 20 cents.

Next **Friday**, the average price of electricity on the power exchange will rise again to over ten cents. Friday's highest forecast price is 17.7 ¢, and the risk of price spikes is high: individual hours could see prices as high as 30-40 cents per kilowatt-hour. The most likely time for peak prices is in the evening, around 5-7 pm.

Over the weekend, prices will remain high. On **Saturday**, the average price will be 10.7 ¢ and the highest forecast price is 17.5 ¢. Saturday, like Friday, has a high risk of price spikes, up to 30-40 cents per kilowatt-hour. On **Sunday**, the average price will fall slightly, but will still remain above eight cents. Sunday's highest price forecast is 15.4 cents, and Sunday also carries a risk that individual hours could see prices rise as high as 20-30 cents.

The high prices and the risk of price spikes are partly explained by the fact that wind power is forecast to be at a low level on several days of the week. Average temperatures will remain around zero or slightly below freezing, which increases electricity consumption.
