*The price of electricity on the spot market is expected to fluctuate significantly in the coming days, with Thursday bringing the highest figures of the week, while the weekend and early next week are projected to see much cheaper hours. Negative prices are even anticipated for Sunday.*

Loviisa 2 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The plant's nominal output is 248.0 MW, but the available capacity is zero. The maintenance outage began on 4 May 2025 at 17:00 and is expected to end on 8 May 2025 at 12:00. This outage may affect the accuracy of price forecasts, as there is only limited training data available from periods of maintenance.

The forecast was updated on Wednesday at 14:24.

This week's electricity price outlook is marked especially by Thursday's high figures. **Thursday** is set to be the week’s most expensive day, with the daily average rising to 12.8 cents and the maximum price peaking at 19 cents per kilowatt hour between 8:00 and 10:00. Exceptionally low minimum wind power production is also predicted for this day, contributing to higher price expectations.

**On Friday**, prices will fall below an average of eight cents. The daily maximum will reach 11.8 cents. However, model predictions indicate a risk of individual price spikes on Friday, which could briefly climb as high as 20 cents, particularly during morning and evening hours. Wind power production remains distinctly low, which may explain the elevated maximum price and the potential for spikes.

**Saturday** will see the average price drop noticeably to 4.4 cents. Hourly prices will range from 2.3 to 5.9 cents, but Saturday also carries a risk of individual price spikes up to 10 cents. The average wind power output remains low, possibly affecting price fluctuations.

**Sunday** is a public holiday, reflected in low electricity demand and clearly the cheapest price expectations of the week. The average price drops to 2.1 cents, and the lowest hourly price even dips into negative territory, reaching -0.5 cents between 14:00 and 16:00. Sunday also carries a risk of hourly price increases up to 10 cents.

**On Monday**, the average price returns to a slightly higher level at 4.1 cents. The maximum price rises to 8.7 cents, and there is a risk of price spikes, possibly during morning or evening hours. On Tuesday and Wednesday, price expectations remain favorable: Tuesday's average is 2.6 cents and Wednesday's is 2.5 cents. No significant price spikes are forecast for Tuesday, but on Wednesday, individual hours can see spikes up to 10 cents.

During the week, electricity prices vary notably between Thursday and the weekend. The most expensive hours are expected around Thursday morning and evening, while Sunday is forecast to have the week’s lowest—and at times even negative—prices. As the week progresses, wind power production increases, which pushes price expectations down from Tuesday onwards.
