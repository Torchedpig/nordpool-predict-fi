The exchange electricity price forecast for the coming week looks mostly affordable. The most expensive day will be **Thursday**, when the average price of the day will rise to 5.6 cents per kilowatt-hour and the highest price of the day will be 9.8 ¢. On other days, average prices will remain below five cents.

However, on **Monday**, a higher hourly price of up to 10.5 cents is expected, which will occur in the late morning between 10 am and 12 noon. Monday's wind power production will fall to just over 2100 megawatts in the late morning, which partly explains the higher price. During the night hours, the price of electricity will be affordable, less than one cent per kilowatt-hour.

On **Sunday** and next week's **Wednesday**, the price of electricity will at times even fall below zero. On Sunday, negative prices are expected in the afternoon from 2 pm to 4 pm, when wind power is abundantly available, up to over 4400 megawatts. On Wednesday, negative prices will occur during the early morning hours.

With the exception of Thursday, the price expectations for the other days of the week are very similar. There is hardly any difference between the days, and the price of electricity will remain moderate.
