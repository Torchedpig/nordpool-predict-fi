The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant will undergo maintenance from 1 March 2025 at 03:00. The maintenance is estimated to end on 2 May 2025 at 02:00. The maintenance break may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data from periods of maintenance outages is limited.

The lower price level at the end of this week will clearly rise starting from **Sunday**. On **Thursday**, **Friday**, and **Saturday**, average electricity prices will remain below one cent. Negative prices will also occur during individual hours on these daysâ€”for example, on **Saturday** afternoon between 13:00â€“15:00, when prices will dip as low as -1.1 cents.

On **Sunday**, prices will increase significantly compared to earlier days. The day's average price will be around five cents, with the highest rates expected during evening hours between 18:00â€“20:00. Prices could then exceed 11 cents per kWh. Sunday carries a high risk of price spikes, potentially reaching up to 20 cents during individual hours.

Next week's most expensive days will be **Monday**, next week's **Thursday**, and **Tuesday**, when average prices will rise notably higher. On **Monday**, the average price will be approximately 11.2 cents, with the highest hourly rates expected in the morning between 08:00â€“10:00, possibly exceeding 19 cents. Given the high risk of price spikes, individual hourly prices could be even higherâ€”up to 30â€“40 cents.

On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, electricity prices will remain high, although slightly lower than Monday's levels. Tuesday's expected average price is 9.7 cents, while Wednesday's average is around 7.6 cents. During these days, the risk of price spikes remains elevated, with individual hourly prices potentially significantly exceeding the forecasted maximum, reaching as high as 20â€“40 cents.

Next week's **Thursday** will see consistently high daily prices, around 12.2 cents. Again, there is a risk of price spikes, and prices during peak hours might reach approximately 30 cents.
