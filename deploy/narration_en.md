The electricity price expectations for the coming week vary considerably. The most expensive day will be **Monday**, when the average price will rise to 13.1 cents per kilowatt-hour. Monday's highest price, 19.3 ¢/kWh, will be in the morning between 8-10 AM. There is also an exceptionally high risk of price spikes of up to 30-50 cents during individual hours on Monday. This is because wind power production is forecast to remain at a very low level during the day, at its lowest only 550 megawatts.

On **Tuesday**, the price of electricity will fall, but there is still a risk that the prices of individual hours could rise up to 20 cents. Tuesday's highest prices will likely be during the morning hours. On **Wednesday**, the price will rise again, and price spikes of up to 20-40 cents are expected during the day. Wednesday's highest price, 17.5 ¢, will occur in the morning between 7-9 AM. On **Thursday**, there is also a risk that the prices of individual hours will rise up to 20 cents.

**Friday's** price expectations are slightly higher than Thursday's. On Friday, there is also a risk that the prices of individual hours will climb up to 20 cents. In contrast, on **Saturday**, electricity will be the cheapest of the week by far, with the average price remaining at only 1.9 cents per kilowatt-hour. During Saturday, the price of electricity will even fall into negative territory during the afternoon and early evening hours, down to -1.4 cents. On Saturday, there will be a very large supply of wind power, which explains the cheap price level.

During the week, only Monday's and Wednesday's average temperatures will fall below -5 degrees Celsius, which partially explains the higher prices. The risk of price spikes on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday should be taken into account, as if they materialize, they could raise the price of electricity higher than forecast. No risk of price spikes is forecast for Saturday.
