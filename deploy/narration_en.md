*Electricity market prices will fluctuate significantly in the coming days: the start of the week sees higher rates and notable risks of price spikes, while towards the weekend prices will drop significantly, even turning negative, particularly on Friday and Saturday thanks to abundant wind power.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The outage began on 1 March 2025 at 03:00, and its estimated end time is 26 April 2025 at 23:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data during maintenance periods is limited.

In the next few days, electricity prices are expected to vary considerably. **Monday** particularly stands out with clearly higher prices compared to other days. The day's average price will rise to nearly seven cents per kilowatt-hour, with peak hourly prices potentially reaching up to 15 cents between 8:00 and 10:00. Additionally, there will be a high risk of further price spikes on **Monday**, where some individual hours could surge to as high as 20‚Äì30 cents. This is partly due to very low minimum wind power generation, falling below 400 megawatts at times.

Prices will also remain somewhat elevated on **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, although clearly more affordable than on Monday. Tuesday's average price will be around 5.5 cents, and Wednesday's about 4.1 cents per kilowatt-hour. Both days have a risk of individual price spikes, though these are expected to be milder than on Monday. On Tuesday, spikes could occasionally reach up to 20 cents, while Wednesday's possible spikes will top out around ten cents.

**Thursday** is a public holiday, and electricity demand is expected to be lower than usual. This will be reflected in electricity prices, with an expected daily average below three cents. Thursday's hourly prices may range from slightly negative early in the morning up to approximately 6.6 cents in the afternoon. A moderate risk of individual price spikes of up to about ten cents is also forecast for Thursday.

As the week progresses, prices will decline further. **Friday** and **Saturday** will see clearly the lowest prices of the week, with daily averages remaining below one cent. Negative prices are possible, especially during night hours and on Saturday afternoon. Wind power generation will be strong on these days, explaining the low price levels. No risk of price spikes is present on Friday or Saturday.
