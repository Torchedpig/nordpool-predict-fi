Electricity prices for the upcoming days will vary notably from day to day. The price range at times will extend from negative values to nearly 50 cents.

**Thursday** will have the week's highest average price at approximately 20.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. The price level will vary significantly within the day; electricity will be cheapest at around two cents in the early morning hours. However, between 7:00 and 9:00 in the morning, prices are expected to rise above 40 cents. The day's peak price of 47.5 cents is likely to occur between 7:00 and 9:00, and high price levels around 30 cents will also appear on Thursday evening between 19:00 and 21:00.

On **Friday**, the average electricity price will decrease notably from Thursday's levels, but the risk of price spikes remains high. According to forecasts, Friday's most expensive hours will occur in the morning between 7:00 and 9:00. The predicted maximum price is around 25 cents, but individual hourly prices could rise as high as 30–50 cents. This is particularly due to low wind power production in the morning, which will occasionally fall below 600 MW.

Among weekend days, **Saturday** clearly stands out as the cheapest. The average price of electricity is expected to remain around three cents, and negative prices will occur at night. Early Saturday morning, between 3:00 and 5:00, electricity prices are forecasted to drop slightly below zero, reaching about minus one cent. The maximum price during the day remains moderate, although there is a slight risk of price spikes up to about 10 cents.

On **Sunday**, the average electricity price will rise to approximately nine cents, and the day carries a high risk of price spikes as well. The forecasted maximum price is around 18 cents, but individual hourly prices might climb to 20–40 cents. Price spikes are most likely to occur during morning hours between 7:00 and 9:00, and again in the evening.

Next week's weekdays will see continued falling prices. On **Monday**, the average electricity price is around seven cents, but the risk for price spikes reaching almost 20–30 cents remains. Individual hourly prices could rise significantly higher than expected. On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, electricity price expectations become clearly more affordable, and the risk of price spikes significantly decreases by Tuesday, almost disappearing by Wednesday.
