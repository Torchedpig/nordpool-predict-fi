*Electricity prices will remain mostly moderate in the coming days, but temporary high-price spikes may occur on Thursday and Tuesday, partly due to intermittent low wind power production. The ongoing maintenance break at Olkiluoto 3 may affect forecast accuracy.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance break, which started on March 1, 2025, at 03:00 and is expected to end on May 2, 2025, at 02:00. This maintenance break may affect the accuracy of this forecast, as historical data from maintenance periods is limited.

Forecast updated on Tuesday at 12:24.

Electricity prices will remain mostly affordable during the coming week, although price fluctuations will be particularly noticeable on **Thursday**. Thursdayâ€™s average price will clearly exceed other days, rising to 4.8 cents per kWh. On certain hours, prices could surge significantly higher than forecasted, even reaching 10â€“20 cents. Thursday's peak price will occur in the morning, approximately between 8:00 and 10:00, with an expected maximum of 16.6 cents. This price spike is partly explained by exceptionally low wind power production in the morning, dropping to just slightly above 500 MW.

For the remainder of the week, no significant price swings are expected. The cheapest hours of the week will occur on **Wednesday**, when electricity prices will turn negative at certain nighttime hours, dropping to -1.5 cents. Negative prices will also be observed during the nights and early mornings of **Friday** and **Monday**, although daily averages will remain moderate.

Over the weekend, prices will be stable and remain at a very reasonable level. On **Saturday**, electricity will cost an average of 2.5 cents, while on **Sunday**, the average will be just one cent. There is no risk of price spikes during the weekend, with the highest hourly price reaching only 5.0 cents on Saturday evening.

At the beginning of next week, on **Monday** and **Tuesday**, prices will rise slightly again. The average prices for both days will be around 4.5 cents, with the highest hourly prices ranging between 8 and 9 cents. Additionally, on **Tuesday**, individual hourly prices may rise up to approximately 10 cents, partly due to relatively low average wind power production.

Overall, the week's price outlook will be variable but still moderate on average. Major price surprises may primarily occur on Thursday morning and Tuesday, when low wind power production increases the possibility of price spikes.
