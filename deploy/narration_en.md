The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear plant will be undergoing maintenance from March 1, 2025 at 03:00 until May 2, 2025 at 02:00. Due to limited training data during maintenance breaks, this may affect the accuracy of the forecast.

Electricity prices will see notable variation depending on the day in the upcoming week. For the most part, electricity will remain affordable, with even negative prices occurring on some days. Most of the time, average prices will remain below two cents per kilowatt-hour.

A particularly favorable day will be **Friday**, when the average price will drop into negative territory (-0.2 Â¢). Throughout the day, several hours will experience negative prices, with the lowest point at -1.4 Â¢. **Wednesday** and **Thursday** will also be quite affordable, with average prices clearly below two cents.

The week's most expensive day will be next **Monday**, when the average price will rise significantly compared to other days, reaching 8.2 cents. This day will also feature the week's highest hourly prices, peaking at 13.6 Â¢ around 8:00 in the morning (between 7:00-9:00). Additionally, a risk of exceptionally high price spikes is forecasted for next Monday. This means hourly prices could surge to between 20â€“30 cents per kilowatt-hour, particularly during morning and evening consumption peaks.

**Saturday** will see the week's second-highest average price, around 2.1 cents. Throughout the day, electricity prices will fluctuate considerably, from a low of -1.4 cents to as high as 7.1 cents. On other days, electricity prices will remain relatively moderate, with no special price risks forecasted.

Throughout the week, abundant wind power will be available on most days, contributing to the low and even negative electricity prices. Mondayâ€™s expensive price level can partly be explained by low wind power production, significantly lower than other weekdays.
