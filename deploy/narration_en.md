Electricity prices will vary considerably in the upcoming week. The largest fluctuations will occur on **Tuesday**, when the daily average price will rise to 8,6 cents. The highest hourly price on Tuesday is forecasted around 15 ¢ between 7:00 and 9:00 in the morning. It is important to note that Tuesday carries a significant risk of even higher price spikes. Prices during individual hours may rise up to 20–40 cents, particularly in the morning or evening. Tuesday's price increases can be explained by exceptionally low wind power production, occasionally dipping below 900 MW.

On **Thursday**, electricity prices will also fluctuate notably. During the day, prices are expected to range from -0,5 cents up to approximately 11 ¢. The highest hourly price on Thursday will occur in the morning between 8:00 and 10:00. Additionally, Thursday has a higher-than-usual risk of price spikes, with hourly prices potentially rising to between 10–20 cents.

The cheapest day for electricity will be **Saturday**, with the average daily price being negative at around -0,3 cents. The lowest hourly price on Saturday will reach -1,6 ¢ in the early morning between 4:00 and 6:00. On **Friday** and **Sunday**, daily average prices will remain low, slightly above one cent. Lower electricity consumption during these holiday days will likely further moderate prices on Friday and Sunday.

On **Monday**, the price level will increase slightly from the weekend's lows, but will still remain moderate. The average price for Monday will be 2,6 cents, with the highest hourly prices occurring in the evening around 19:00–21:00.
