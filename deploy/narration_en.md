The electricity price expectations for the coming week vary considerably. Prices will fall very low during the weekend and early next week, but next **Thursday** will see a clearly more expensive day. The average price for Thursday is forecast to be 9.4 ¢/kWh, and the highest price of the day could rise as high as 17.7 cents per kilowatt-hour.

On **Friday**, the price of electricity will settle at an average of 2.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. The cheapest hours of the day will be in the early morning, when the price will even fall below zero. At its most expensive, electricity will be around six cents in the early evening. The average temperature on Friday will be -3.4 degrees Celsius.

During Saturday and Sunday, electricity will be very cheap. The average price on **Saturday** will be only 0.4 cents, and on **Sunday** only 1.1 cents per kilowatt-hour. Both days will even see negative hourly prices.

Also next **Monday**, the price of electricity will remain low, with an average price of 0.8 ¢/kWh. Some negative hourly prices are expected in the early morning. On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, the average price will rise to 2.6 cents, but will still remain affordable. On Wednesday morning, even negative prices are expected momentarily.

Next Thursday, the price of electricity will rise significantly. The average price will be 9.4 ¢/kWh, and the intraday variation will be large. At its cheapest, electricity will be in the early morning, even at -1.1 cents, but the price will rise rapidly during the morning. The highest price of the day, 17.7 ¢, will probably be between 7 and 9 am. There is also a high risk of individual price spikes on Thursday, when prices could momentarily rise as high as 20-40 cents per kilowatt-hour. The rise in prices is partly due to the fact that wind power will be available significantly less on Thursday than on other days, and production will fall to a minimum of only 1266 megawatts.
