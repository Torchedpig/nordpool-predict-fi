*Electricity prices will vary significantly in the coming week: the week starts expensive, with price peaks on Monday, but steadily decreases towards the weekend, even turning negative. Friday and Saturday will offer the week's lowest prices, as abundant wind power generation pushes costs to record-low levels.*

Electricity prices will differ notably between days during the upcoming week. Price fluctuations will be significant both from day to day and within individual days.

The week's highest price will be on **Monday**, with an expected maximum of 15,1 cents between 07:00–09:00. This high price is due to very low wind power generation, with a minimum production level of only 318 megawatts. Additionally, Monday carries a considerable risk for price spikes, with individual hourly prices potentially rising as high as 20–30 cents.

Prices will remain moderately high on **Tuesday**, with an average just above five cents. However, price variations during the day will be less extreme than on Monday. There is still a risk of price spikes on Tuesday, potentially pushing individual hours up to 20 cents.

As the week progresses, prices will gradually decrease. On **Wednesday**, the average price will drop slightly above two cents, and on **Thursday**, which is a public holiday, electricity prices are expected to be even lower. Reduced electricity consumption on the holiday will result in average prices below one cent. Thursday's lowest hourly prices will even turn negative during early morning hours and again in the afternoon between 15:00–18:00.

The cheapest days of the week will be **Friday** and **Saturday**, when abundant wind power production will push average prices to around zero or even negative. The week's lowest hourly price, -1,6 cents, will occur on Friday night between 01:00–03:00. There is no risk of price spikes on these days.
