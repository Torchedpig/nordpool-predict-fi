In the coming week, electricity market price expectations will vary daily. **Thursday** stands out with the highest predicted maximum price, rising to 24.8 cents per kilowatt-hour, although the day's average price remains more moderate at 7.1 cents. This could be due to the low wind power minimum production, which is only 1986 MW. On **Friday** and **Saturday**, price levels remain moderate, with Friday's average price at 6.9 cents without significant risks of price spikes.

**Saturday** offers the week's lowest average price at 3.9 cents, with average wind power production at a high level. **Sunday** sees slightly higher prices but remains below 8 cents. **Monday** brings a slightly higher average price of 7.0 cents, but price variation is limited.

**Tuesday** and **Wednesday** are expected to see rising prices, particularly on Wednesday, when the average price reaches 9.4 cents and the maximum price 14.7 cents. However, Tuesday poses a significant risk for price spikes, with individual hourly prices potentially rising to 20 cents. This risk is particularly present during morning and evening hours. The most expensive day appears to be **Wednesday**, while the most affordable moments occur on **Saturday**. ðŸ”®
