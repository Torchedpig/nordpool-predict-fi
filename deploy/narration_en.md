Exchange electricity price expectations will vary during the coming week. Both cheap and more expensive days are expected.

On **Friday**, the average price of electricity will settle at 6.1 cents per kilowatt-hour. Friday is the only day of the week when the price of electricity can rise to over 20 cents. The cheapest hours of the day will be in the early morning, when the price can fall to below 0.5 cents.

On **Saturday**, the average price of electricity will fall to 2.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. Saturday has the lowest price of the week. The price will remain below 5 cents all day.

On **Sunday**, the price will rise to 7.7 cents. However, there is a high risk of price spikes on Sunday, up to 20-30 cents for individual hours. The risk of price spikes is related to weak wind power in the morning and evening. Sunday's wind power is forecast to remain below 400 megawatts at times.

On **Monday** and **Tuesday**, average prices will rise to close to 10 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Monday, there is a risk of individual price spikes, up to 20 cents. On Tuesday, the risk of price spikes is even higher, up to 20-40 cents for individual hours. The highest hourly prices on Tuesday will be in the evening, between 18:00 and 20:00.

Next **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, the price of electricity will fall again, with average prices settling around 4-5 cents. Wednesday will be the coldest day of the week, at -4.3 degrees.
