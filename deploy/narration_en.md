Next week, electricity prices will clearly vary from day to day. **Tuesday** particularly stands out as the most expensive day, with an average price approaching 15 cents/kWh and a maximum forecasted price as high as 25 cents. There is a considerable risk of price spikes, and hourly prices may rise as high as 30‚Äì60 cents. The highest prices will likely occur Tuesday evening between 19:00‚Äì21:00.

**Wednesday** and **Thursday** will also be relatively pricey days. On Wednesday, the average price is expected to be around 10 cents, but the risk of price spikes remains, potentially elevating hourly rates to 20‚Äì40 cents. Wednesday morning from 07:00‚Äì09:00 will see the highest prices. On Thursday, average prices will rise to 11,5 cents, with hourly rates forecasted to peak above 22 cents in the morning between 07:00‚Äì09:00. Thursday also carries a significant risk of spikes, possibly reaching 30‚Äì50 cents.

The most affordable days of the week will be **Friday** and **Sunday**, with average prices staying below five cents. On Friday, prices will be lowest early in the morning between 05:00‚Äì07:00, dropping below two cents. Saturday will also remain relatively moderate, with an average price slightly over six cents, although there is still a small risk that hourly rates could rise up to 20 cents.

**Monday** is a public holiday, clearly reflected in its lower average electricity price compared to other weekdays. Price levels on Monday will range from 0,8 cents to over 18 cents in the evening, but the day as a whole remains moderate at approximately 6,3 cents.

Wind power production fluctuates significantly throughout the week. On Tuesday and Thursday, average wind power falls below 1300 MW, contributing to the high price peaks on those days. On Friday, strong wind power availability is clearly reflected in the week's lowest average price.
