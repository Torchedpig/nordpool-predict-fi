*Next week's electricity price forecast highlights a brief price peak on Monday, when low wind power production pushes prices above 14 cents; otherwise, the week offers consumers very affordable electricity, even with negative prices, especially over the weekend.*

Olkiluoto 1 nuclear power plant is undergoing a maintenance outage. The outage started on 11 May 2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 22 May 2025 at 18:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast since training data from comparable situations is limited.

In the coming week, electricity prices will show clear fluctuations, especially on **Monday**. Mondayâ€™s expected average price will rise to 4.3 cents, and the maximum price will climb as high as 14.1 cents between 8:00 and 10:00. According to the forecast, there is indeed a high risk of price spikes during that time. This situation is largely due to very low wind power production, which drops as low as 276 megawatts on Monday. Typically, weak wind power drives prices upward, and this appears to be the case this time as well.

Other days of the week will offer significantly more affordable prices, with daily averages mostly remaining below one cent. On **Sunday**, the average price will even be negative, at -0.1 cents, with price fluctuations ranging from -1.2 cents to two cents. Negative prices will mainly occur during nighttime and afternoon hours, hitting the lowest levels between 13:00 and 14:00.

On **Tuesday**, the average electricity price will remain modest at 0.5 cents, but certain individual hours carry a risk of price spikes. The maximum price will reach 2.2 cents in the morning, between 9:00 and 10:00. Wind power production on Tuesday will also remain relatively low, which could explain the brief price increases.

From midweek onwards, from **Wednesday** through Friday, prices will remain generally low with minor fluctuations. Wednesday's highest price will be 4.1 cents in the morning between 9:00 and 10:00, but the day's average will remain below one cent. On **Thursday** and **Friday**, price variations will be even smaller, and prices will stay below two cents throughout the days.

On the weekend, specifically on **Saturday**, prices will remain stable but briefly dip negative again in the afternoon around 14:00â€“15:00. Saturdayâ€™s average price will be 0.8 cents, with moderate price fluctuations.

Overall, the week's price trend will be characterized by Monday's brief price peak, clearly standing out from the rest of the days. Otherwise, the week appears highly affordable for consumers, with negative prices providing opportunities for exceptionally cheap electricity usage, particularly during Sunday and Saturday.
