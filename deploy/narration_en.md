Next week's electricity price forecast will be highly variable. From Sunday to Monday, there will be a clear shift from the week's inexpensive start to notably higher prices.

On **Saturday**, prices will remain exceptionally low throughout the day. The day's average will be only 0.2 cents, and at certain times during night and day, prices will even fall negative. This is due to strong wind power production bringing abundant electricity generation and driving prices downward.

On **Sunday**, electricity prices will begin to rise significantly. The expected average price for the day increases to 7.6 cents. Especially in the evening hours between 19:00 and 21:00, prices will climb to nearly 19 cents. Additionally, Sunday carries a high risk of price spikes, during which prices could rise to as high as 20‚Äì30 cents for individual hours. This is clearly linked to considerably lower wind power generation, with a minimum output of only 282 MW.

However, **Monday** will be the most expensive day of the week, with electricity averaging above 13 cents. Price fluctuation will be significant, with daily prices ranging from just under six cents to over 21 cents during the morning hours between 09:00 and 11:00. Wind power production on Monday will be low, averaging only 800 MW, explaining the higher prices. Monday also has a high risk of price spikes, potentially reaching 30‚Äì50 cents in individual hours.

Following Monday, prices will quickly return to affordable levels. On **Tuesday**, average prices drop to approximately 2.2 cents, on **Thursday** to 1.2 cents, and on **Friday** to just 0.2 cents. Wednesday's average price also remains low, just over four cents. Particularly on Thursday and Friday, negative electricity prices are again expected during nighttime and daytime hours, thanks to strong winds and plentiful wind power production.

The week concludes next **Saturday**, with electricity prices remaining very affordable‚Äîan average of only 0.1 cents. Wind power generation will be exceptionally high and stable, keeping prices low throughout the entire day.
