The price forecast for exchange electricity shows variations during the upcoming week. Prices are expected to rise towards the end of the week, with the most expensive day likely to be next Monday.

On **Tuesday**, the average price of electricity is expected to be 5.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. The daily variation is moderate, with the price remaining between 1.9 and 8.1 cents. The cheapest hours of the night will be in the early evening.

On **Wednesday**, the average price will rise slightly from Tuesday, to around 6.0 ¢/kWh. The price will vary between 1.3 and 8.9 cents. The cheapest hours on Wednesday will be around midnight.

On **Thursday**, the price of electricity will rise significantly. The average price is forecast to be 9.0 ¢/kWh, and the daily variation is large, as the price will move from 3.5 cents to as high as 16.1 cents. Thursday also has a high risk of price spikes, where the prices of individual hours can rise to as much as 20-40 cents per kilowatt-hour. The most likely time for a price spike is in the afternoon, around 5-7 PM. This is partly due to the fact that wind power production will drop significantly during the day on Thursday, reaching a low of only 1279 MW.

**Friday's** average price will be slightly lower than Thursday's, at around 8.3 ¢/kWh. The price will vary between 4.8 and 11.7 cents. There is also a risk of price spikes on Friday, with individual hourly prices potentially rising as high as 20 cents. Wind power production will remain below average on Friday, which will have some impact on the price level. In addition, Friday will have chilly weather, with the average temperature dropping to -5.6 degrees Celsius.

On **Saturday**, the average price of electricity will fall to 6.5 cents. The price will remain between 3.7 and 9.0 cents. On Saturday, the price of electricity will be at its lowest during the early morning hours. The temperature will be -7.6 degrees Celsius.

On **Sunday**, the price of electricity will fall further, and the average price is forecast to be 4.6 ¢/kWh. The price will vary between 2.3 and 8.0 cents. Sunday's cheapest hours will again be in the early morning. Sunday will be the coldest day of the week, with an average temperature of -8.8 degrees Celsius.

Next **Monday**, the price of electricity will rise to its highest level of the week. The average price is expected to be 12.4 ¢/kWh, and the price will rise during the day from 4.5 cents to as high as 22.1 cents. Monday also has a high risk of price spikes, where the prices of individual hours can rise to as much as 30-50 cents per kilowatt-hour. The most likely time for a price spike is in the early evening, around 5-7 PM. Monday's high price is partly explained by the fact that wind power production will remain, on average, at a very low level, only 1988 megawatts. The freezing temperature of -8.2 degrees will also increase the price of electricity.
