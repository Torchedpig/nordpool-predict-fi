The price of electricity on the exchange will vary significantly in the coming days. There will be both more expensive and cheaper days ahead.

On **Tuesday**, the average price of exchange electricity will be 9.8 ¢/kWh, and the price will vary between 5.9 ¢ and 13.8 ¢. The average price is therefore higher than usual. The average temperature on Tuesday will be -8.3 °C.

The average price for Thursday is forecast to be 10.3 ¢/kWh. The price will be at its lowest at 5.3 ¢ and at its highest at 16.2 ¢. The minimum wind power production will remain low on these days, which partly explains the rise in prices.
