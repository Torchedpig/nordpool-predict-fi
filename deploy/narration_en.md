*This week's electricity price forecast indicates significant fluctuations: early in the week, the risk of price spikes may push rates up to 20 cents, but from Wednesday onwards, abundant wind power generation will keep prices very low, occasionally even negative.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage. The outage began on March 1, 2025 at 03:00 and is forecasted to end on May 2, 2025 at 02:00. This maintenance outage may impact the accuracy of the electricity price prediction, as limited training data is available from comparable situations.

Forecast updated on Saturday at 14:18.

During the upcoming week, electricity prices will vary significantly from day to day. The fluctuations in prices will be mainly due to substantial variations in wind power production. The week will start with above-average prices on **Monday**. The day's average price will be 8.4 cents per kilowatt-hour, and the highest hourly prices will be just under 15 cents during morning hours between 8:00‚Äì10:00 and evening hours from 20:00‚Äì22:00. Monday also carries a forecasted risk of price spikes, potentially pushing individual hourly prices as high as 20 cents.

**Tuesday** also includes a forecasted risk of high price spikes, even though its average price will remain moderate at 6 cents. Price variability on Tuesday will be exceptionally high. Prices will decrease rapidly towards Tuesday evening, with overnight hours potentially experiencing negative prices, reaching as low as -0.3 cents.

The week‚Äôs most affordable days will be mid to late-week. **Wednesday** will be the cheapest day, with an average price of just 0.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. Prices will be lowest during early morning hours, dropping to as low as -0.9 cents. Low prices will continue on **Thursday** and **Friday**, maintaining very low average prices of 2.4 cents on Thursday and 1.6 cents on Friday. On Thursday, the lowest prices will occur between 14:00‚Äì20:00, potentially becoming negative again. On Friday, prices will be lowest during early morning hours.

The low price level will continue over the weekend. **Saturday** will have an average price of only 0.5 cents. During the day, electricity prices will drop significantly, reaching as low as -2.6 cents around midday hours.

The negative prices observed throughout the week will be particularly due to the high wind power production, peaking on Wednesday with generation exceeding 5000 megawatts. Overall, the upcoming week will offer consumers opportunities to take advantage of affordable electricity hours, but the price volatility early in the week will require careful attention to hourly rates.
