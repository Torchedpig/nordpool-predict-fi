Electricity price forecasts for upcoming days remain mostly affordable. Average prices throughout the week stay close to or below four cents per kilowatt-hour. The highest single-hour prices occur on **Thursday**, when maximum prices may reach up to 8.6 cents. Additionally, on **Monday** evening between 18:00â€“20:00, prices might briefly exceed five cents.

Weekend electricity price forecasts look moderate. **Saturday's** average price will be half a cent, and **Sunday** even lower at just 0.1 cents. On both days, prices will temporarily turn negative. For instance, on Sunday afternoon between 15:00â€“17:00, prices could drop as low as two cents below zero.

However, there is a risk of hourly price spikes on Sunday and Monday. On Sunday morning between 8:00â€“10:00, the highest price could reach 2.6 cents. On Monday evening between 18:00â€“20:00, prices could rise as high as 5.3 cents. According to the data, there is no risk of price spikes on other days.

Towards the end of the week, average prices rise slightly. Thursday's average price will reach 2.4 cents, and on Friday the highest average price of the entire week is expected at 3.8 cents. However, hourly prices on Friday remain moderate, with the highest hourly rate being 6.1 cents at midnight between 23:00â€“01:00.

Wind power production throughout the week is mainly at normal levels, but on Monday wind power generation will drop significantly lower, to a minimum of 1080 megawatts, partly explaining Monday evening's higher maximum price. On other days, wind power does not significantly influence price expectations.
