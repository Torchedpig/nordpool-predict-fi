Electricity price expectations will vary during the coming week. **Wednesday** and Thursday look like cheap days, with the average price of electricity remaining below two cents per kilowatt-hour. On Wednesday, the price may even fall below zero.

From Friday onwards, prices will rise. On **Friday**, the average price will rise above seven cents, and on Sunday the price will already be significantly more expensive. On Monday and Tuesday, the average prices of electricity will climb to double digits.

The most expensive day of the week is forecast to be **Tuesday**, when the average price will rise above 11 cents. On Tuesday, there is also a high risk of price spikes: the prices of individual hours can rise up to 30-40 cents per kilowatt-hour. There is also a risk of price spikes on Friday, Sunday and Monday. In this case, the price of electricity may temporarily rise up to 20 cents.

Price spikes are likely to occur during the morning and afternoon hours. For example, on Tuesday, the highest prices will be around 8-10 am. On Friday, Sunday and Monday, peak prices are likely to be in the early evening, around 6-8 pm.

Wind power production will be at a high level at the beginning of the week, which partly explains the low prices. Towards the end of the week, wind power production will decrease, which is reflected in the rise in electricity prices. Especially on Monday, wind power is forecast to be scarce, with an average of less than 2000 megawatts.
