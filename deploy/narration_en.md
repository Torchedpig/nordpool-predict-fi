The price forecast for exchange electricity for the coming week shows variable, but mostly normal winter readings. On Wednesday, the price will rise higher. Towards the end of the week, the price will fall slightly, but will rise again at the beginning of next week.

On **Wednesday**, the average price of exchange electricity will rise to 9.0 cents per kilowatt-hour. The highest price of the day will rise to 20.3 cents, which is clearly the highest figure in the entire week's forecast. The price peak is likely to occur during the morning hours of 9-11. Wednesday's price is partly explained by the fact that wind power is forecast to be at its lowest at only 1499 megawatts.

On **Thursday** and **Friday**, the average prices of electricity will settle at 7.5 and 8.2 cents. Although the average prices are close to each other, individual hours on Thursday and Friday may see price spikes of up to 20 cents. On Friday, the temperature will drop well below -5 degrees, which may have some effect on the price.

On **Saturday**, the average price of exchange electricity will be 7.5 cents. On Sunday, the price will fall to 5.5 cents, making **Sunday** the cheapest day of the week. On Saturday and Sunday, wind power is forecast to be abundantly available, which may explain the drop in prices. Sunday's lowest prices, 3.0–3.4 ¢, will occur during the night and morning hours.

Next **Monday**, the average price of exchange electricity will rise again, to 9.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. Monday is also forecast to have the second highest maximum price of the week, 17.1 cents. Prices for individual hours could rise as high as 20-40 cents, so price spikes should be expected on Monday. Next **Tuesday**, the average price of exchange electricity will fall to 7.8 cents.
