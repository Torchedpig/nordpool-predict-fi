Electricity price expectations will vary during the coming week. **Wednesday** and Thursday look affordable, but from Friday onwards prices will rise.

**Friday** stands out as the most expensive day of the week. The average price for Friday is forecast to be 7.7 ¢, and the intraday variation is large, with a low of 3.6 ¢ and a high of 16.0 ¢. The large variation in wind power production is likely to explain the price differences.

At the beginning of next week, on **Monday**, the price of electricity will rise again. The average price for Monday is forecast to be 9.4 ¢, and the highest price of the day could be as high as 14.0 ¢. Wind power production will be at a low level on Monday, with an average of 2542 MW, and during the day production will fall to a low of only 1386 MW. A risk of price spikes is also forecast for Monday, with prices for individual hours potentially rising up to 20 cents.

On **Tuesday**, the price will remain high, with an average price of 8.4 ¢. The highest price on Tuesday could rise to 13.4 cents. Wind power production will remain low on Tuesday, averaging 2350 MW.
