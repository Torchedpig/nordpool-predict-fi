*The electricity spot price level will remain mostly affordable in the coming week, with possible price spikes and even negative prices on Tuesday; Olkiluoto 3's maintenance outage adds uncertainty to the forecast.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant currently has a maintenance outage, which started on 1 March 2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on 2 May 2025 at 02:00. The maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data during maintenance periods is limited.

The forecast was updated on Sunday at 12:01.

Electricity price forecasts for the coming week will vary significantly from day to day. Price levels will mainly remain affordable, although greater fluctuations will occasionally occur. The cheapest day of the week will be **Wednesday**, when the average price will fall to 1.2 cents, and negative prices (as low as -1.4 ¢) are expected during nighttime hours. Similarly, on Tuesday evening and night, electricity prices are expected to turn negative, reaching a low of -0.6 cents.

The highest hourly price of the week will occur on **Tuesday** morning between approximately 7 and 9 am, when the electricity price is forecast to rise to 10.5 cents. Additionally, there is a risk on Tuesday of price spikes for individual hours, potentially adding up to 10 cents more, momentarily pushing prices even above 20 cents. A significant contributing factor is the very low forecasted wind power production minimum of only 610 MW.

Thursday and Saturday's average prices will rise slightly above four cents, but these days will still remain affordable. On Saturday, the highest prices will occur between 6 pm and 8 pm, approaching ten cents. Otherwise, the weekdays will be quite similar to each other, without dramatic price changes.

Throughout the week, wind power generation will generally remain abundant. The only notable exception will be the weak wind production on Tuesday morning, which, as mentioned, will increase the morning hourly prices. Wind power production levels on other days will not significantly affect prices.

Negative prices will be possible next week, especially during Tuesday evening and night, and early Wednesday morning. At these times, electricity production is forecast to significantly exceed demand, momentarily pushing prices below zero.

The week's price forecast is notably influenced by the ongoing long maintenance outage at Olkiluoto 3, adding uncertainty to the forecast accuracy.
