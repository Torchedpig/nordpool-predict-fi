The price forecast for exchange electricity for the coming week varies considerably. There are both more expensive and cheaper days ahead.

On **Monday**, the average price of exchange electricity is expected to be 13.0 ¬¢/kWh. The highest price of the day may rise to 23.6 cents per kilowatt-hour, while the lowest price will fall to 4.3 cents. Monday's high price is partly explained by the fact that wind power is forecast to be available only in small amounts, at its lowest only 712 MW. Monday's price peak will be between nine and ten in the morning.

On **Tuesday**, the average price is expected to fall to 10.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. Tuesday's forecast suggests that the price of electricity could range from 2.5 cents to 14.6 cents. However, it should be noted that on Tuesday there is a high risk of price spikes, with prices for individual hours potentially rising to 30-40 cents. The risk of a price spike is greatest on Tuesday afternoon between two and four o'clock.

On **Wednesday**, the average price of exchange electricity will rise to 14.7 cents. Wednesday's predicted price range is 7.6 - 21.7 ¬¢/kWh. It is worth noting that on Wednesday there is a high risk of price spikes, up to 30-60 cents per kilowatt-hour for individual hours. The risk of a price spike is in the afternoon between two and four o'clock. Wednesday's price is boosted by very low wind power production, which falls to a low of just 59 MW.

On **Thursday**, the average price of exchange electricity will settle at 11.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. Thursday's price expectations range from 4.7 to 18.8 cents. Thursday also has a high risk of price spikes, with prices for individual hours potentially rising to 30-50 cents. The risk of a price spike is greatest between eight and ten in the morning.

On **Friday**, the price of electricity will fall significantly, with an average price forecast of 5.7 ¬¢/kWh. On Friday, the price will vary between 3.3 and 8.8 ¬¢. On Friday, wind power will be abundant, which explains the lower price level.

Over the weekend, the price of exchange electricity will fall very low. On **Saturday**, the average price will be 3.9 ¬¢ and on **Sunday** 4.3 ¬¢ per kilowatt-hour. During Saturday and Sunday, the price of electricity will occasionally fall to below two cents per kilowatt-hour. The low price over the weekend is explained by very abundant wind power production.
