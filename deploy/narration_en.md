The price of exchange electricity will be variable during the coming week. Electricity will be most expensive on **Friday**, when the average daily price is expected to be 9.8 ¢/kWh. Friday's maximum price, 16.7 ¢, will occur during the morning hours between 8-10 am. Price spikes are also forecast for Friday, when the prices of individual hours can rise to as much as 20-40 cents.

Saturday's average price, 8.6 ¢, will be close to Friday's level. On **Saturday**, the highest prices, around 13 ¢, will be in the evening between 6-8 pm. On Saturday, there is also a risk that the prices of individual hours will rise to as much as 20 cents. The risk of price spikes is related to the fact that wind power is forecast to be at its lowest at just over a thousand megawatts.

On **Sunday**, the price of electricity will fall significantly. The average daily price is expected to be 3.8 ¢. On Sunday, wind power will be abundant, with an average of 4662 MW, which will push prices down. Sunday's cheapest hours will be in the early morning, when the price may even drop below one cent.

Next **Monday** and **Tuesday**, electricity will be even cheaper than on Sunday. The average price for Monday is forecast to be 3.0 ¢ and for Tuesday only 1.9 ¢. On Tuesday, it is even possible that the price of electricity will temporarily fall below zero, most likely in the first hours of the night between 00-02. The low prices are explained by the very abundant wind power, as on Tuesday wind power will be available at an average of 5540 MW.

Next **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, the price will rise again, but will still remain affordable. The average price for Wednesday is expected to be 3.4 ¢ and for Thursday 4.5 ¢. Wind power will be available on Wednesday and Thursday less than at the beginning of the week, but still more than average.
