The Olkiluoto 1 nuclear power plant is experiencing a production restriction that began on 22 May 2025 at 09:00. According to forecasts, it will end on 24 May 2025 at 01:00. During this restriction, the plant operates at 5.6% of its nominal capacity. This restriction may affect the accuracy of electricity price forecasts, as historical training data for similar situations is limited.

Overall, electricity prices during the week will remain low, with no single day reaching the expensive electricity price category on average. Prices will generally remain below three cents, and daily average price differences throughout the week will be minor. Negative hourly prices will repeatedly occur, especially during nighttime and midday hours.

The cheapest day of the week will be **Monday**, when the average electricity price is expected to be slightly negative, at -0.2 ¢. On Monday, the lowest hourly prices occur from 01:00 to 03:00, falling to about -1.5 cents. On **Tuesday**, average prices will also remain around zero, briefly dipping negative during nighttime hours.

The week's highest predicted prices will occur on **Wednesday**, with an expected average price of 2.6 cents.

Variations in wind power production affect the week's price fluctuations. On Sunday, wind power generation averages only 790 MW, significantly below normal, contributing to price increases up to five cents during early morning hours between 06:00 and 08:00. On Monday and Tuesday, abundant wind power availability will help maintain low electricity prices.

**Thursday** is a public holiday, during which electricity demand is expected to be lower than usual. This will keep Thursday's prices moderate, peaking at 2.8 cents.

Overall, the week will offer modest electricity prices, though individual hourly price spikes may occur, particularly on Wednesday and Friday.
