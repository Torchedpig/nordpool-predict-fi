The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage. The outage began on March 1, 2025 at 03:00 and is forecasted to end on May 2, 2025 at 02:00. This outage may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as historical data during maintenance outages is limited.

The electricity price forecasts for the upcoming days show considerable variations. Significant differences appear in the average daily prices throughout the week. The cheapest day will be **Sunday**, when the average price drops into negative territory (-0.1 ¢). Conversely, **Monday** stands out as the most expensive day of the week, with an average price of around five cents per kilowatt-hour.

The highest hourly price of the week will occur on **Thursday** morning between 7:00 and 9:00, reaching up to 22.4 cents. The price spike on Thursday morning is primarily due to wind power production dropping to very low levels (only about 505 MW). However, prices will quickly fall after the morning hours, making electricity significantly cheaper by the afternoon.

The weekend days, **Saturday** and Sunday, will be very affordable. Both days feature negative minimum prices during the night and early morning hours. This is primarily because of abundant wind power production, significantly lowering the price. Saturday’s average price will be only around 1.2 cents, and on Sunday electricity will be practically free with an average price slightly below zero.

On **Monday**, however, prices will rise again. The day's peak price is forecasted around 15 cents, with a considerable risk of price spikes. Individual hourly prices may rise up to 10 cents higher than the forecasted maximum. This risk particularly affects the morning hours between 8:00 and 10:00, when electricity might become substantially more expensive for brief periods.

Prices for Tuesday and Wednesday return to more moderate levels. Average daily prices for both days will remain below three cents, and there is no risk of price spikes. Thus, the middle of next week again appears as an affordable period for electricity users.
