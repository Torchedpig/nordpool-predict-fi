*Electricity market prices are set to decrease towards the end of the week as wind power production increases and Sunday’s public holiday reduces demand. At the start of the week, individual hourly price spikes may reach high levels, but from early next week, prices are expected to remain moderate and stable.*

The Loviisa nuclear power plant’s Loviisa 2 unit is undergoing maintenance from 4 May 2025 at 17:00, with the shutdown expected to end on 8 May 2025 at 12:00. This maintenance outage may affect forecast accuracy, as historical data from similar periods is limited.

At the end of the week, electricity market prices are forecast to drop steadily from Thursday to Sunday. The highest average price is expected on **Thursday**, with the price rising to 6.5 cents per kilowatt-hour and the day's peak hourly price reaching 11.2 cents. There is also a predicted risk of significant price spikes on single hours, potentially up to 20 cents. Such spikes are most likely to occur between midnight and 10 a.m. on Thursday, when wind power production is at its lowest.

**Friday** prices remain close to Thursday’s level, at 6.0 cents per kilowatt-hour. A similar risk of hourly price spikes up to 20 cents is forecast, especially during the morning between 7 and 9 a.m. The higher prices on Thursday and Friday are explained by low wind power production, which remains well below one thousand megawatts on average.

Prices decrease towards the weekend. **Saturday** sees the average price fall to 4.0 cents, with hourly prices ranging from 2.4 to 5.6 cents. While wind power remains relatively low, the risk of price spikes is smaller than on previous days: any spikes are expected to reach at most 10 cents, mainly occurring during the morning and early afternoon.

**Sunday** is a public holiday, resulting in lower than usual electricity demand and a drop in prices. The day’s average price is projected at 2.4 cents, with the lowest hourly price falling to just 0.3 cents. Some price spikes up to 10 cents are possible, particularly during the late morning hours.

The new week begins on **Monday**, with the average price rising to 3.5 cents and hourly prices varying between 1.4 and 7.8 cents. There is a risk of hourly price spikes up to 10 cents, mainly during the morning between 7 and 9 a.m., but the average price remains clearly lower than on Thursday or Friday.

On **Tuesday**, electricity prices continue to drop, and the day’s average remains at 2.2 cents. Prices are stable throughout the day, and no significant risk of hourly price spikes is forecast. Wind power production increases significantly, supporting the lower prices.

Next **Wednesday**, electricity prices are expected to remain moderate, with an average of 3.0 cents and hourly rates between 1.0 and 6.1 cents. There is a risk of price spikes up to 10 cents on individual hours, particularly during the evening hours between 10 p.m. and midnight. Wind power production will be near typical levels.

The most affordable hours of the week are forecast for Sunday and Tuesday, when both average and minimum prices are especially low. The highest hourly prices and potential price spikes are seen at the start of the week on Thursday and Friday, coinciding with the lowest wind power production. Price fluctuations level out towards the start of the new week as wind power generation increases.
