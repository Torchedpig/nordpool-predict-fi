Electricity prices in the coming week will vary moderately, without significant price spikes. **Friday** and **Saturday** show relatively low average prices, staying slightly below five cents. On these days, wind power production is relatively strong, which partially explains the low prices. **On Sunday**, prices rise slightly, with the average price expected to be seven cents, which is higher than in the early days of the week. This is partly due to lower wind power production.

**Monday** is forecasted to be the most expensive day of the week, with an average price of 8.1 cents. This may be due to lower wind power production and cold weather. **On Tuesday**, prices decrease slightly but remain above an average of seven cents. **Wednesday** again offers more affordable prices, with an average price of 4.6 cents, comparable to the levels at the beginning of the week.

**Thursday** sees a slight increase in prices again, with an average price of 6.3 cents. This day also stands out for the variation in wind power production, which may affect price developments. In summary, electricity prices in the coming week are generally moderate, without significant price spikes. üå¨Ô∏è
