According to the forecast for the coming days, electricity prices will mostly remain at low levels. However, small differences between days and variation within individual days will occur.

The week's lowest average prices will be recorded on **Sunday** (-0,4 ¢) and **Monday** (-0,3 ¢). The lowest hourly price on Sunday will even reach -1,9 ¢ between 13:00 and 15:00, and on Monday the lowest prices will be at -1,4 ¢ between midnight and 02:00. Negative prices will mostly occur during night-time and early afternoon hours.

Slightly higher average prices will appear on **Friday** and **Saturday**, when prices rise above one cent on average. Saturday's hourly prices will also show significant variation. The week's highest price spike will occur on Saturday morning between 07:00 and 09:00, reaching over four cents (4,2 ¢). This spike will likely be due to the day's unusually low minimum wind power output, around 1359 MW.

Other weekdays will remain quite moderate in terms of prices. Average prices on **Thursday**, **Tuesday**, and **Wednesday** will hover around zero, while peak prices will not rise significantly. For example, Thursday's prices will vary modestly between 0,2–1,2 ¢. On Tuesday and Wednesday, peak prices will also remain moderate, around two to three cents.

Throughout the week, negative hourly prices will occur on multiple days, especially at night and early afternoon. This variation in prices means electricity users can potentially benefit from timing their consumption to the cheapest hours.
