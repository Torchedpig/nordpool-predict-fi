Electricity price expectations will vary during the coming week. Next **Wednesday**, the average price will rise to 5.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, and the intraday variation will be large: at its cheapest, electricity will be available for less than one cent, but at its most expensive, the price will climb close to 15 cents per kilowatt-hour. Wednesday's high maximum price is likely partly explained by the fact that wind power is forecast to be at its lowest at 1961 MW.

On other days, the price will be clearly cheaper. Particularly affordable days will be **Saturday**, when the average price will remain at 1.2 cents, and **Monday**, when the average price will be only 0.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Saturday, the price of electricity is expected to temporarily dip slightly below zero. Negative prices are also expected on Monday.

On **Thursday**, freezing temperatures are expected, as the average daily temperature is forecast to be -9.3 degrees Celsius. The freezing temperatures are likely to raise the price of electricity, and the average price is predicted to be 4.2 ¢/kWh.

This coming **Tuesday**, wind power production is forecast to be at its lowest at only 2179 megawatts. At the same time, the maximum daily price is estimated to be 7.3 ¢/kWh.

Overall, electricity prices will fluctuate during the coming week but will remain mostly at an affordable level. Wednesday is the only day when the price will rise significantly higher, but even then, only temporarily.
