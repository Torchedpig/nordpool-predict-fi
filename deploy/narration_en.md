The price of electricity on the exchange will remain on the expensive side during the coming week, although a decrease is expected in the price forecasts towards the end of the week. The coming week will start with high prices, but on **Friday** and **Saturday**, average prices will fall well below six cents per kilowatt-hour.

On **Sunday** and next **Monday**, the average price of electricity will rise close to 13 cents. The hourly forecasts for Sunday and Monday show a high risk of price spikes, where the prices of individual hours can rise up to 30-50 cents. On Sunday, the minimum production of wind power will remain very low, at only 143 megawatts, which partly explains the high price level. On Monday, more wind power will be available, on average 2033 megawatts, but even then, the daily variation will be large.

Next **Tuesday**, the average price will fall to 10 cents, but even then there is a risk of price spikes for individual hours, up to 20 cents. On Tuesday, wind power is forecast to be 2682 megawatts on average, but the daily variation is large, and during the lowest hours of the day, only 1803 megawatts of wind power will be available.

On **Wednesday**, the average price of electricity will rise slightly from Tuesday's figures, to 10.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. A high risk of price spikes is also forecast for Wednesday, up to 30-40 cents for individual hours. Wednesday's price spikes are likely to occur during the afternoon and early evening hours, around 5-7 PM. Wind power production on Wednesday will be 2388 megawatts on average, but in the afternoon, production will fall well below half of this.

Next **Thursday**, the average price is expected to settle at 8.6 cents, and on Friday and Saturday, average prices will fall well below six cents. Towards the end of the week, the temperature will also rise, which will contribute to a lower electricity price. Even on Thursday there is still a risk of price spikes during individual hours, up to 20 cents.
