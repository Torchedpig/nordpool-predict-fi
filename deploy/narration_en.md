The upcoming week is forecast to have generally affordable electricity exchange prices. Daily average prices will range from 0.3 cents to just under three cents per kilowatt-hour. However, noticeable daily fluctuations in price levels will occur and should be considered in electricity usage.

The week's highest hourly prices will occur on **Wednesday**, when prices could spike to 7.8 cents during individual hours. The risk of price spikes on Wednesday will be significantly elevated, with peak prices occurring in the morning between approximately 08:00–10:00. Wednesday’s higher momentary prices can be attributed especially to the temporary low wind power production, dipping to a minimum of 1310 MW.

Another day with potential price spikes will be **Saturday**. On Saturday, average prices remain below two cents, but during individual evening hours around 20:00–22:00, prices could rise to 4.6 cents. On Sunday, attention should also be given to hourly price variability, although the day's overall average remains very affordable.

The week's most affordable days include especially **Tuesday**, **Thursday**, and **Monday**, each with average prices below one cent. On these days, negative hourly prices will be observed during nighttime. For example, early Tuesday morning between 04:00–06:00, electricity prices will remain very close to or even slightly below zero.

Friday's prices will be slightly above average, with a daily average of just over two cents. However, negative overnight prices on Friday help balance out the day's average, despite afternoon and evening prices rising up to four cents at their highest.

Throughout the upcoming week, price variations will be relatively significant, but overall, the week will appear affordable for consumers. Nevertheless, daily differences should be taken into account when planning electricity usage.
