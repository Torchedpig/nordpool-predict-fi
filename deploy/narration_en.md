The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The maintenance began on 1 March 2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on 29 April 2025 at 07:00. This maintenance break may affect forecast accuracy, as there is limited historical data available from periods of nuclear plant outages.

The coming week will bring notable variations in electricity spot prices. Price developments will start at a higher level on **Wednesday**, when the day's average price is expected to reach 8.6 cents. Prices will vary from nighttime lows around six cents to early morning highs reaching almost 15 cents between midnight and 1 AM. There is also a risk of price spikes on Wednesday, pushing prices temporarily up to as much as 20 cents during individual hours.

On **Thursday**, the situation will change significantly due to the public holiday reducing electricity demand. The daily average price will fall below four cents. Electricity will be cheapest on Thursday afternoon between 15:00-17:00, at just 0.7 cents, but at 8:00 in the morning the price will briefly rise to 7.6 cents. There is also a risk of price spikes on Thursday, potentially reaching up to ten cents per kilowatt-hour.

Towards the weekend, prices will drop even further. On **Friday** and **Saturday**, exceptionally low prices are expected, as strong wind power generation keeps the electricity market very affordable. On both days, some hours will even have negative electricity prices, meaning consumers could benefit from practically free electricity, especially during the day on Saturday.

Prices will begin to rise again slightly during **Sunday** and **Monday**, but electricity will still remain relatively affordable. Sunday‚Äôs average price will remain slightly above two cents, and Monday‚Äôs around five cents per kilowatt-hour.

The week's price trend will conclude with rising prices next **Tuesday**. Higher prices are anticipated, with the day's average price around 7.7 cents. During the late evening period between 21:00-23:00 on Tuesday, prices may rise to over 13 cents, and there is also potential risk of price spikes reaching up to 20 cents per kilowatt-hour during individual hours.
