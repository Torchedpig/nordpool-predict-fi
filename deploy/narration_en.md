Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is undergoing maintenance, which began on March 1, 2025, at 03:00 and is expected to continue until April 26, 2025, at 23:00. This maintenance may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data during nuclear plant outages is limited.

In the upcoming week, electricity prices will show clear variations between days. **Wednesday** will be the most expensive day on average, with the price forecasted at 5.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. Wednesday's highest hourly price will occur in the evening between 18:00 and 20:00, potentially reaching 10.4 cents. The risk of price spikes on Wednesday will also be elevated, with individual hourly prices possibly climbing up to 20 cents.

Early in the week, prices will also fluctuate notably. On **Monday**, the day's average electricity price will be 4.3 Â¢, and the highest price, 13.1 Â¢, is expected in the morning hours between 07:00 and 09:00. Monday will also carry a risk of price spikes, with hourly prices potentially rising up to 10 cents. The relatively low minimum wind power production during morning hours partially explains these higher prices.

On **Tuesday**, prices are expected to be more stable, although there remains a risk of price spikes. Tuesday's peak price of 7.6 Â¢ will occur in the evening between 20:00 and 22:00. Also on Tuesday, individual hourly prices could reach up to 10 cents.

The cheapest days of the week will be **Friday** and **Thursday**, with average electricity prices remaining below two cents. Friday will have the week's lowest average price at just 0.7 Â¢, with the highest price of 3.4 Â¢ occurring in the evening between 20:00 and 22:00. Thursday's average price will also be notably low at 1.5 Â¢. Thursday is a public holiday, potentially reducing electricity demand and thus lowering prices. However, Thursday still carries a risk of price spikes, with individual hourly prices potentially reaching as high as 10 cents.

Weekend prices will remain moderate, although the risk of price spikes will increase on Sunday. On **Sunday**, the average price will be 2.9 Â¢, with the highest hourly rate of 5.9 Â¢ occurring in the morning between 07:00 and 09:00. However, individual hourly price spikes could still push prices up to 10 cents.
