*Electricity prices will fluctuate significantly in the next few days; Sunday will be exceptionally affordable, whereas Tuesday brings high average prices and potential price spikes due to low wind power production and the ongoing maintenance outage at Olkiluoto 3.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is undergoing scheduled maintenance. The outage began on 1 March 2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on 2 May 2025 at 02:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of forecasts, since limited training data is available from similar outage periods.

Forecast updated on Thursday at 03:13.

Electricity prices will vary significantly in the coming days. Clearly the most expensive day is **Tuesday**, when the average price of electricity is predicted to rise above nine cents per kilowatt-hour. Tuesday's highest price peaks will occur during early evening hours, approximately between 17:00 and 19:00. The forecast model warns of possible price spikes, which could drive electricity prices up to about 20–40 cents per hour. Tuesday's high maximum price is connected to low wind power production, dropping as low as 821 megawatts.

Prices on **Saturday** and **Monday** will also be somewhat elevated, with average prices rising above five cents. On Saturday, the most expensive hour is in the morning between 08:00 and 10:00, when prices reach 11.6 cents. Saturday's wind production will be particularly low, momentarily dipping below 500 megawatts. Both Saturday and Monday carry a risk for price spikes as well. Individual hourly prices might surpass the forecasted prices considerably, rising potentially to around 20 cents.

On **Sunday**, electricity consumers will clearly benefit from significantly lower prices. The day's average price will be slightly above one cent, and during nighttime and morning hours, negative prices will even occur. Electricity is cheapest on Sunday in the early morning hours between 04:00 and 06:00, when the price drops to -1.6 cents. Sunday's affordability is partly due to abundant wind power production, averaging nearly 2900 megawatts throughout the day. There is no risk of price spikes on Sunday.

On other days, the price level will remain moderate, with average prices staying around or below five cents. **Friday** and **Wednesday** will also experience individual hours when electricity is inexpensive or even negative. Thursday will also see a slight risk for price spikes, but the overall price level is expected to remain reasonable throughout the day.

The week's price trend will be highly variable. The significant differences in price levels primarily result from fluctuations in wind power production and consumption changes on public holidays, where demand could be lower. Additionally, the ongoing maintenance outage at Olkiluoto 3 may introduce uncertainty into the price forecast.
