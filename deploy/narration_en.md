Throughout the upcoming week, electricity price forecasts indicate significant fluctuations both in average and maximum prices. **Wednesday** is expected to have the lowest average price of the week, around 2.8 ¢/kWh, partly due to abundant wind power production, which varies widely throughout the day. As a result, minimum prices are also extremely low, even reaching zero cents per kilowatt-hour.

On **Thursday** and **Friday**, the price level rises significantly, with average prices around 7.2 and 8.1 ¢/kWh. On these days, wind power production is lower, which partly raises the electricity price. **Friday's** maximum price rises to 13.3 ¢/kWh, a significant increase compared to the beginning of the week.

**Saturday** offers a more affordable option, with an average price of 5.0 ¢/kWh. This is again due to increased wind power production, which stabilizes the electricity price. However, the weekend continues on a more expensive note, as **Sunday's** average price rises to 8.3 ¢/kWh. Price spikes are also expected on Sunday, which could raise the prices of individual hours to as much as 20 cents.

Next **Monday** and **Tuesday**, average prices are expected to be high, at 8.2 and 9.4 ¢/kWh. Particularly on **Tuesday**, there is a significant risk of price spikes, as wind power production may remain very low, which, together with low minimum production, increases price variability. Tuesday's maximum price could rise to 15.5 ¢/kWh according to forecasts, but actual spikes could be even higher.
