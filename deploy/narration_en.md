Electricity price expectations will vary during the coming week. On **Friday** and **Saturday**, average prices will settle at a clearly higher level than on other days. From Sunday onwards, the price will fall, and after the weekend, the price will be cheap.

The higher-than-expected average prices of 7.7 ¢ and 7.6 ¢ per kilowatt-hour on Friday and Saturday are partly explained by low wind power production. On Friday, the minimum available wind power is only 830 MW, and on Saturday, only 1007 MW. On Saturday, there is also a risk of higher price spikes than on Friday, up to 20 cents per kilowatt-hour during individual hours. The price peak is likely to occur in the afternoon and early evening hours, around 5-7 PM.

On **Sunday**, the price of electricity will turn downwards. The average price for the day is expected to be 3.2 ¢ per kilowatt-hour, and the price will vary between 0.8 cents and 6.6 cents during the day. On Sunday, there will be plenty of wind power available, with an average of 4861 MW.

Next **Monday** and **Tuesday**, the price of electricity will continue to fall. The average price for Monday is forecast to be 2.7 ¢ and for Tuesday, only 1.6 ¢ per kilowatt-hour. On Wednesday, the price will remain low, and the average price for the day is expected to be 1.9 ¢. Wednesday's hourly prices may even fall into negative territory (-0.4 ¢) in the early hours of the morning. Next Thursday's average price is 2.4 ¢ per kilowatt-hour.

This coming weekend, the price of electricity will therefore be higher than during the week. From Sunday onwards, the price will be cheap.
