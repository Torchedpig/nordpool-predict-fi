The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is undergoing a maintenance outage from 01.03.2025 at 03:00 until 02.05.2025 at 02:00 according to current forecasts. This outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data during such outages is limited.

Next week's price forecast shows significant variation between days. On **Sunday**, electricity prices will remain close to zero throughout the day, even dipping into negative territory during nighttime and afternoon hours. Sunday's lowest price, -1.2 cents, is expected between 13:00 and 15:00. Similarly, **Saturday** will also experience a very low average price, around 0.1 cent, including negative hours.

The week's peak prices will occur on **Wednesday**, with the average daily electricity price rising significantly compared to other days, at approximately 8.8 cents. The highest price on Wednesday is expected in the morning between 07:00 and 09:00, reaching around 14.4 cents. There is also an elevated risk of even higher price spikes on this day, possibly reaching between 20 and 40 cents during individual hours. Wednesday's unusually high prices can primarily be explained by very low wind power production, at times just slightly above 1000 megawatts.

On **Thursday**, prices will remain relatively high, averaging around 6.3 cents. Thursday's highest price, approximately 13.2 cents, is forecasted for the morning hours between 08:00 and 10:00. Thursday also has a forecasted risk of individual price spikes reaching around 20 cents per hour.

For the rest of the week, electricity prices will remain considerably more moderate. **Monday** and **Tuesday** average prices will be between 2 and 3 cents, with no significant price peaks anticipated. On **Friday**, prices will also stay moderate, around an average of 3.6 cents, likewise without notable peaks.

Negative pricing will occur during nighttime hours on several days throughout the week, indicating moments when electricity production exceeds demand. Overall, the week will be varied, and consumers should particularly note the higher prices on Wednesday and Thursday.
