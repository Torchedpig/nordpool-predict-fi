The price of exchange electricity will remain mostly affordable at the beginning of the coming week. Towards the end of the week, the price will rise slightly, but will still remain moderate. Next **Monday**, however, the price will rise significantly, even becoming expensive.

On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, the price of electricity will fall below zero at night. Wednesday's average price will settle at only 0.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Wednesday, a large amount of electricity will be produced by wind power, which will push the price down.

Towards the end of the week, from **Thursday** onwards, the price of electricity will rise slightly. During Friday and the weekend, however, the price will still remain below four cents per kilowatt-hour.

A high average price of 9.4 cents is forecast for next Monday. Monday's maximum price could rise above 15 cents. On Monday, there will be significantly less wind power available than on other days. The scarcity of wind power and the cooling weather will raise the price. On Monday, there is also a risk that the prices of individual hours will rise to as much as 20-40 cents per kilowatt-hour. The price spike is likely to occur during the morning hours, around 7-9 am.
