*Electricity prices will mostly remain affordable in the coming days due to abundant wind power, but next Tuesday, as winds weaken, prices may rise up to 15‚Äì20 cents per kilowatt-hour.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage. The outage started on 01.03.2025 at 03:00 and is estimated to end on 02.05.2025 at 02:00. This maintenance outage might affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data during outages is limited.

The electricity price forecast was updated on Tuesday at 12:00.

Electricity prices will mostly remain affordable this week. Average daily prices will generally stay below four cents per kilowatt-hour, and during several days, prices will even dip into negative territory.

The cheapest day of the week will be **Friday**, with an average electricity price of only 0.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. The lowest hourly price on Friday will be -0.9 cents during nighttime hours.

On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, electricity prices will also remain low, around one cent per kilowatt-hour. Negative prices on these days will mainly occur during the early morning hours. The affordability over the weekend is partly due to abundant wind power production, occasionally rising above 5000 megawatts.

At the start of the week, on **Monday**, electricity prices will begin to rise slightly. The daily average price will climb to over five cents, with the highest prices reaching around 11 cents during the evening hours. This modest increase is partly linked to occasionally lower wind power production.

Clearly, the most expensive day of the week will be next **Tuesday**, when the average price will approach eight cents. Between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, the electricity price will peak at nearly 15 cents. The risk of price spikes is elevated on Tuesday, and individual hourly prices may reach as high as 20 cents. Wind power production on Tuesday will fall significantly to the week's lowest level, making higher prices likely.

The week's fluctuating price pattern is mainly explained by changes in wind power availability. Prices will remain particularly affordable on windier days, whereas reduced wind power will cause prices to rise.
