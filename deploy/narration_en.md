Electricity price expectations on the exchange will vary considerably in the coming days. The cheapest days will be **Thursday** and Saturday, when average prices will settle at just over two cents per kilowatt-hour. The most expensive days are forecast to be next Monday and Tuesday, when average prices will rise above ten cents.

The high prices next Monday and Tuesday are partly explained by the low production volumes of wind power, which will remain well below 1500 megawatts on both days at their lowest. The freezing temperatures after the weekend may also contribute to higher prices.

Over the weekend, electricity prices will fluctuate. On Saturday, the price will occasionally fall close to zero, while on Sunday the price could rise to almost 13 cents at its highest.

Price spikes are also expected next week. Next Monday, prices for individual hours could rise to as much as 30-50 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Tuesday, the risk of price spikes is similar, up to 30-40 cents. Even on Wednesday, there is still a high risk of price spikes, with electricity prices potentially reaching 20-40 cents. The price spikes will likely occur during peak consumption hours in the morning and evening, for example on Monday around 8-10 am and 6-8 pm.

At the beginning of next week, the price of electricity will rise, but on Wednesday price expectations will turn downwards. Wednesday's average price, 8.6 ¢, will be significantly lower than the previous days, and even at its highest, the price is expected to remain below 20 cents.
