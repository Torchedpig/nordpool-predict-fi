Electricity prices over the coming days are expected to vary significantly from day to day. The lowest prices will occur on **Saturday**, when the daily average price is expected to be slightly negative, at -0.1 cents per kilowatt-hour. Prices will also remain very low on **Friday** and **Sunday**, clearly under one cent on average. These days will also feature negative prices, especially during nighttime and early morning hours.

Significantly higher prices are expected on **Tuesday**, when the average daily price will rise to 8.7 cents. According to the forecast, Tuesday's maximum price might reach as high as 16 cents between 7–9 in the morning. Additionally, there is a considerable risk of price spikes on Tuesday, with individual hours potentially reaching prices as high as 20–40 cents. This is particularly due to the low minimum wind power production of only 665 MW, increasing upward pressure on prices.

**Thursday** and **Monday** will also show clearly elevated price levels with a notable risk of price spikes. On Thursday, the daily average is 4.5 cents, but between 8–10 in the morning, the electricity price could exceed 10 cents, with a risk of spikes reaching 10–20 cents. Monday’s average price is 3.8 cents, but prices might rise close to 10 cents between 19–21 in the evening, with the potential for single-hour price spikes.

On **Wednesday**, the price level will remain moderate, with a daily average of 5.2 cents. However, Wednesday will also include a risk of individual price spikes, potentially reaching up to around 20 cents per hour.

The weekend holidays (**Friday**, **Sunday**, and **Monday**) reduce electricity demand, partially explaining the low price levels on these days. Consequently, noticeable differences between weekdays emerge clearly in both pricing and wind power production, which is reflected distinctly in the variation of daily forecasts.
