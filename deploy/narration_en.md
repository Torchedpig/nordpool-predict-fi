The price of electricity on the exchange is expected to fluctuate significantly in the coming days. There will be both more expensive and cheaper days ahead.

On **Tuesday**, the average price of electricity is expected to be 9.0 ¢/kWh. The price will remain fairly stable throughout the day, ranging from 6.1 cents to 11.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. The average temperature on Tuesday will be -8.3 degrees Celsius.

On **Wednesday**, the price of electricity will rise, and the average price is expected to be 12.8 ¢/kWh. Wednesday also has a high risk of price spikes. The prices of individual hours can rise up to 30-50 cents. The risk of price spikes is highest in the morning between seven and nine, and in the evening between six and eight. During the day, wind power production will occasionally drop very low, which partly explains the increase in prices. The average temperature for Wednesday is forecast to be -9.3 degrees Celsius.

On **Thursday**, the average price will decrease slightly from Wednesday, settling at 9.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. However, price spikes are also expected on Thursday, when the prices of individual hours can rise up to 20-40 cents. Price spikes are most likely to occur in the morning between seven and nine, and in the afternoon between four and six. Wind power production will also remain low at times on Thursday. The average temperature will remain at -9.3 degrees Celsius.

On **Friday**, the price of electricity will turn to a clear decline. The average price is expected to be 2.8 ¢/kWh, and the price will vary between 0.5 cents and 5.5 cents. On Friday, there will be plenty of wind power available, which will push the price down.

During the weekend, electricity will be cheap. On **Saturday**, the average price will rise slightly from Friday, to 4.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. Going into **Sunday**, it is already close to zero, as the average price for the day is expected to be only 0.2 ¢/kWh. On Sunday, the price of electricity will even fall into negative territory during the early morning and afternoon hours. Next **Monday**, the price will remain very low, with an average price of 0.7 ¢/kWh. There will be a very large amount of wind power available during the weekend and next Monday, which explains the low prices.
