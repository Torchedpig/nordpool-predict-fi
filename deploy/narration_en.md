The electricity price forecast for the coming days shows significant variations between days and even between individual hours. Clearly the most expensive day will be **Thursday**, when the average electricity price will reach 15.4 cents/kWh. On Thursday morning between 8 and 10 o'clock, prices will peak at around 29.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. Additionally, there is a high risk of price spikes on Thursday, potentially rising up to 40-60 cents during individual hours.

**Wednesday** will also experience notable price volatility. Although the day's average price will remain at 11.6 cents, high prices will occur during the morning hours. Prices will peak between 7 and 9 a.m., rising to more than 40 cents. However, in the afternoon prices will drop significantly, and between 14 and 18 o'clock electricity will be nearly free, at around half a cent per kWh.

**Friday’s** average price will be nearly the same as Wednesday’s, at 11.7 cents. On Friday morning between 8 and 10 o'clock, electricity prices will be around 29 cents according to forecasts, but there is a high risk of price spikes, potentially pushing prices up to 30-50 cents. This is due to very weak wind power production during the morning hours, driving prices upwards.

Prices will moderate during the weekend. On **Saturday**, the average electricity price will fall to 6.1 cents, with relatively low prices throughout the day. Even at its highest, the price will barely exceed 13 cents. Nevertheless, there is still a risk that prices could briefly rise to approximately 20 cents during individual hours.

On **Sunday**, prices will slightly rise again, reaching an average of 9.9 cents. The highest forecasted price for the day will be slightly below 20 cents, but the risk of price spikes remains high, potentially reaching 20-40 cents during individual hours. Again, the risk of price spikes is associated with weak wind during morning hours.

At the beginning of next week, prices will clearly decline. On **Monday**, the average price will be 6.5 cents, and on **Tuesday** even lower, at just 5.0 cents. No risk of price spikes has been forecasted for Tuesday, and even the most expensive hour of the day will remain below 10 cents. Electricity will be particularly affordable on Tuesday afternoon, dropping under one cent during the early morning hours.
