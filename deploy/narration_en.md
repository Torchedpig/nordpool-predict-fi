The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage, which started on 1.3.2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on 26.4.2025 at 23:00. This outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as limited training data is available from outage periods.

The upcoming week's electricity price forecast will feature significant variation both between individual days and within specific hours. The highest average prices of the week are anticipated on **Monday** and **Tuesday**, with the daily average expected to rise to 5.7 cents. On both days, there is also a notable risk for considerable price spikes, possibly reaching as high as 20 cents during individual hours. These price peaks could occur particularly in the morning between 7‚Äì9 AM on Monday and between 7‚Äì9 AM on Tuesday, when consumption typically reaches its highest levels.

The cheapest day of the week will be **Friday**, when the average price is expected to remain exceptionally low at just 0.5 cents. On Friday, the electricity price will even dip into negative territory during nighttime hours, with the lowest price reaching -1.5 cents. The weekend will also feature several hours with negative prices, such as early Saturday morning between 3‚Äì5 AM and during Saturday afternoon between 1‚Äì3 PM.

Wind power generation will vary significantly throughout the week, clearly impacting price expectations. On Monday and Tuesday, average wind power output will remain relatively low, around 1500 MW, and occasionally even below 1000 MW. This limited production partly explains the higher maximum prices early in the week. As the week progresses, wind power production is expected to pick up, averaging over 3200 MW by Friday, contributing to lower prices towards the end of the week.

**Thursday** is a public holiday, and electricity demand is expected to be lower than on a typical weekday. This may help lower the electricity price, with Thursday's average price forecasted at a moderate 2.6 cents. However, Thursday still carries a risk of price spikes during individual hours, potentially reaching up to 10 cents.

The week's price outlook clearly demonstrates how sensitively electricity prices respond to fluctuations in wind power output and consumption patterns. For consumers, the largest price variations will occur early in the week, whereas towards the week's end, the electricity market situation is expected to stabilize and move towards lower prices.
