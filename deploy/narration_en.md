Electricity price expectations will vary during the coming week. Electricity will be most expensive on **Wednesday**, when the average price of the day will rise to 15.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. Wednesday's highest price, 21.1 ¢, will be between 8-10 am. On Wednesday, there is also a risk that the prices of individual hours will rise to as much as 40-60 cents.

After Wednesday, the price of electricity will fall, and the weekend is expected to be cheap. On **Saturday**, the average price will remain at 3.6 cents and on **Sunday** as low as 2.7 cents. On Sunday, the price of electricity will even fall into negative territory during the early morning hours.

Next **Monday**, the price of electricity will rise again, and the average price for the day is predicted to be 7.7 ¢. A risk of price spikes has also been predicted for Monday, and the prices of individual hours may rise up to 20 cents per kilowatt-hour.

On **Tuesday**, **Wednesday**, and **Thursday**, there is a high risk of price spikes. On Tuesday, the prices of individual hours can rise up to 30-40 cents, on Wednesday 40-60 cents, and on Thursday 30-50 cents. Especially on Wednesday, wind power is predicted to be very low, only 75-755 MW, which partly explains the high price level. Also on Tuesday and Thursday, the minimum production of wind power will remain low, which may raise prices.

The average temperatures for the whole week will remain below freezing.
