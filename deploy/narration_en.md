*Electricity prices will fluctuate significantly in the coming days; prices will dip into negative territory during the weekend, but Monday is expected to see considerable price spikes due to weak wind power generation. The maintenance outage at Olkiluoto 3 adds uncertainty to the forecast.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage. The outage began on 01.03.2025 at 03:00 and is expected to continue until 02.05.2025 at 02:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as training data from periods of outages are limited.

Electricity markets in the coming days will vary significantly. The forecast shows both extremely low and exceptionally high electricity exchange prices ahead.

On **Friday** and **Saturday**, average prices will remain very low. Friday‚Äôs average will be just 0.4 cents, while Saturday‚Äôs price will even dip slightly negative, at -0.1 cents. On Saturday, the price will reach as low as -1.0 cents during nighttime and early afternoon hours. This low price level is due to strong winds, keeping wind power generation consistently high on both days.

The situation will change notably on **Sunday**, as wind power generation occasionally drops below one thousand megawatts, causing prices to rise significantly. Sunday's average price is forecast at 5.5 cents, with the day's price peak of 14.8 ¬¢ expected between 21:00 and 23:00. There is an elevated risk of price spikes on Sunday, possibly reaching as high as 20 cents during individual hours.

The most expensive day of the week will be **Monday**, when the average electricity price will rise to 11.8 cents. This rise is mainly due to exceptionally weak wind production, averaging well below one thousand megawatts. Monday‚Äôs peak price is expected in the morning between 08:00 and 10:00, potentially reaching nearly 25 cents. Additionally, Monday carries a high risk of significantly larger price spikes, possibly reaching 30‚Äì50 cents during individual hours.

On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, the situation will ease slightly, but prices will remain relatively high. Tuesday's average price is estimated at 7.5 cents, and Wednesday's average will again rise above ten cents. Both days carry clear risks of price spikes, with maximum prices potentially rising to 20‚Äì30 cents on Tuesday and even 30‚Äì40 cents on Wednesday. The price fluctuations on these days are largely due to variable wind power generation, which occasionally drops to relatively low levels.

Towards the end of the week, electricity prices will return to lower levels. On **Thursday**, the average price will be only 3.5 cents, remaining relatively stable due to strong wind power. Next **Friday**, prices will continue to be stable, settling around 3.8 cents throughout the entire day.
