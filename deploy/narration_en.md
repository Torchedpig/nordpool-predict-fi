Electricity prices will vary significantly over the coming week. Early in the week, prices will remain generally affordable, but on Thursday prices will rise notably. During the weekend, prices will decrease again to very low levels.

The week's highest prices will occur on **Tuesday**, with prices forecasted to reach as high as 17.1 cents per kWh between 19:00 and 21:00. **Thursday's** expected average price will be the week's highest, at 5.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. Additionally, on Thursday there will be a particularly high risk of price spikes, potentially driving hourly prices as high as 20‚Äì30 cents.

**Friday** is a public holiday, which may reduce electricity demand compared to normal. This is reflected in prices, as Friday's average electricity price will be very low, only 0.3 cents. Prices will remain extremely affordable on Saturday as well, with the day's average price practically at zero cents.

On **Sunday** and next **Monday**, prices will rise slightly but will remain relatively affordable, around three cents on average. However, both days have increased risks of price spikes, potentially reaching up to 10 cents per hour.

Wind power production will significantly influence price fluctuations this week. On Friday and Saturday, strong wind production‚Äîaveraging over 3000 MW‚Äîwill largely explain the low electricity prices. Conversely, Thursday's minimum wind power production will be very low, dropping to just 416 MW, contributing to higher daily prices and increasing the risk of price spikes.
