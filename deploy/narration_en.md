The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance, which started on 1.3.2025 at 03:00 and is forecasted to end on 2.5.2025 at 02:00. The maintenance break may affect the accuracy of price forecasts, as training data during maintenance periods is limited.

In the coming week, electricity prices will vary significantly from day to day and even hour to hour. Based on daily averages, the beginning of the week will be relatively expensive compared to previous weeks, but from Wednesday onward, prices will clearly decrease.

The highest prices of the week will occur on **Monday**, when the daily average electricity price will rise to 8,6 cents per kilowatt-hour. Price fluctuations throughout the day will be substantial, with the most expensive period occurring in the morning between 8:00–10:00, when prices will exceed 14 cents. Additionally, Monday has been forecasted to have a high risk of price spikes, meaning that single-hour prices could rise significantly above the forecasted maximum, even reaching 20–40 cents.

On **Tuesday**, signs of strong price variations will also be present. The highest-priced hour will fall in the morning between 7:00–9:00, with prices exceeding 16 cents. Tuesday also carries a forecasted risk of price spikes, meaning individual hours could significantly surpass the forecasted maximum price, potentially reaching 20–30 cents.

From Wednesday onward, however, the price level will drop considerably, and **Wednesday** will see the week's lowest daily average price at 0,4 cents. During the day, electricity prices will remain close to zero or even slightly negative, due to exceptionally strong wind power production. Wednesday's lowest price will reach -0,8 cents, indicating that electricity generation will momentarily surpass demand.

The latter part of the week will continue to be affordable. On **Thursday**, prices will vary between -0,3 and 13,3 cents, but the day's average price will remain relatively low at 3,6 cents. On **Friday** and **Saturday**, prices will decrease further, and on both days, the average price will clearly remain below three cents. On Saturday, price fluctuations will be minor, with the highest price only reaching 4,7 cents.
