The price of electricity on the Nord Pool exchange will be volatile in the coming week. In the coming week, price expectations will range, on average, from about 1.2 to 11.1 cents per kilowatt-hour.

On **Sunday**, the average price of exchange electricity is expected to settle at a very affordable level, around 1.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. The price will remain low throughout the day, varying between 0.3 and 3.3 cents. Sunday's low prices are explained by strong wind power production, which averages 3565 megawatts during the day.

On **Monday**, the price will rise, but will still remain reasonable. The average price for the day is expected to be 4.7 ¢/kWh. Monday's lowest price could fall as low as -0.5 cents, but the day's highest prices will rise above seven cents.

On **Tuesday**, the average price of exchange electricity is estimated to be 5.5 ¢/kWh. The price will vary during the day from 1.8 cents to 9.7 cents. The average price is slightly higher than on Monday, but the price differences within the day will be smaller.

On **Wednesday**, the average price is forecast to rise to 8.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. The intra-day variation will be greater than on Tuesday, with the price moving between 4.6 cents and 13.3 cents. However, Wednesday's forecast carries a risk of isolated price spikes, which could push hourly prices up to 20 cents.

Next **Thursday**, the average price of exchange electricity will rise further, and is expected to be 9.9 ¢/kWh. The price will peak at 18.1 cents, but could fall to a low of 3.3 cents. Wind power production will be significantly lower on Thursday than on previous days, which partly explains the rise in prices. There is also a high risk of price spikes on Thursday, with prices for individual hours potentially rising to 20-40 cents. The most likely time for a price spike is between 5 PM and 7 PM.

Next **Friday**, the average price of exchange electricity will rise to 11.1 cents, the highest of the week. A high risk of price spikes is also forecast for Friday, with prices for individual hours potentially rising to 30-40 cents. The rise in prices is partly explained by low wind power production, which will average only 1343 megawatts. Friday will also see the average daily temperature drop to -5.6 degrees Celsius, which may increase electricity consumption.

Next **Saturday**, the average price of exchange electricity will fall slightly from Friday, settling at 8.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. High price spikes are also expected on Saturday, with prices for individual hours potentially rising to 20-30 cents. The average temperature on Saturday will be -7.6 degrees Celsius, the lowest of the week.
