Electricity price forecasts for the coming days will remain mainly affordable. The greatest fluctuations will be seen on **Thursday** and especially on **Friday**. On Thursday, the average price of electricity is expected to be 4.8 cents, with peak prices rising during the day as high as 12.6 cents between approximately 07:00–09:00.

Friday will be clearly the most expensive day of the week regarding average price, with the average price rising close to six cents (5.9 ¢). Peak rates on Friday could climb even higher than forecasted, possibly reaching up to 20 cents for individual hours. The most likely timing for these price spikes on Friday will be in the morning between 07:00–09:00 and again in the evening around 19:00–21:00. Friday’s higher prices are partially explained by wind power production being lower compared to other days of the week, averaging around 2462 MW.

On Saturday, prices will return to a more moderate level around four cents, although there remains a small risk of individual price spikes around ten cents. On Sunday, electricity prices will drop significantly, with the day's average price near zero (0.1 ¢). Several negative-price hours will occur on Sunday, especially in the afternoon and evening, with the lowest price around -1.0 cents between 15:00–17:00.

On Monday, prices will continue to stay very low, with an average price below two cents. The day will also see a few negative-price hours, especially during the night immediately after midnight.

The week's price level will be characterized by significant fluctuations: Friday’s relatively high prices differ noticeably from Sunday and Monday’s very low, occasionally negative prices.
