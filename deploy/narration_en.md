Next week, the price expectations for exchange electricity will vary. The week is divided into two parts: at the beginning and end of the week, the price of electricity will be higher than in the middle of the week. Electricity will be most expensive next Monday, when the average price for the day is expected to be 5.1 ¬¢/kWh, and at its most expensive, electricity will be 10.7 ¬¢/kWh.

The price of electricity will fall well below zero on the night between next Tuesday and Wednesday. On Tuesday morning, between 00:00 and 05:00, the price of electricity will be around zero or even below zero. On the night before Wednesday, the price will be at its lowest at -1.3 ¬¢/kWh. Also on **Wednesday** during the day, the price will remain low. The average price for Wednesday is predicted to be only 1.1 ¬¢.

Next **Tuesday**, there will be plenty of wind power available at the beginning and end of the week, which will push the price of electricity down. During next Tuesday and Wednesday, wind power will be produced at a maximum of over 5000 megawatts.

On **Monday**, there will be less wind power available, which partly explains the higher price level on Monday. On the night between Monday and Tuesday, wind power production will decrease to less than 2000 megawatts.

Next **Saturday**, the price of electricity will rise again. The average price for Saturday is expected to be 3.7 ¬¢, and the highest price of the day will rise to 9.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Saturday, there will be significantly less wind power available than on other days, which is reflected in the price of electricity.
