*Early in the week, electricity prices will rise significantly due to weak wind power production, but from Wednesday onwards, strong winds will push prices very low, even into negative territory ‚Äî the maintenance outage at Olkiluoto 3 may affect forecast accuracy.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is undergoing a maintenance outage, which began on 1.3.2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on 2.5.2025 at 02:00. This outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data from maintenance periods is limited.

The price forecast was updated on Sunday at 12:00.

The week's electricity price forecast will show a clear difference between the higher prices at the beginning of the week and the very low prices towards the weekend.

The week's most expensive day will be **Monday**, when the average electricity price will rise above 12 cents per kilowatt-hour. Monday's price fluctuations will also be substantial: the cheapest overnight hours will be below five cents, but between 9 and 11 in the morning, the price will rise to about 20 cents. Additionally, Monday will carry a significant risk of individual hourly price spikes, potentially pushing prices as high as 30‚Äì50 cents per kilowatt-hour, particularly between 9‚Äì11 in the morning or 19‚Äì21 in the evening.

On **Tuesday**, the price will still be relatively high, averaging around 9,5 cents. Within Tuesday, price fluctuations will again be notable: the cheapest night and late evening hours will be around 4‚Äì5 cents, while between 9‚Äì11 in the morning, the price may rise up to 13 cents. On Tuesday too, individual hourly prices might exceed the forecasted figures, possibly reaching around 20 cents.

From Wednesday onwards, the price level will drop significantly towards the weekend. On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, average prices will remain below five cents. Particularly on **Friday**, the average electricity price will drop below one cent, and negative prices will even occur during the day. For example, overnight between Friday and Saturday, prices will dip below zero, reaching as low as -1,5 cents.

During the weekend, the electricity price level will remain very low. On **Saturday**, the average price will be below one cent, with prices dropping below zero multiple times. On **Sunday**, the average price will rise slightly above three cents but will still remain very affordable.

Higher prices on Monday and Tuesday can be partly explained by weak wind power production. Monday, for example, will see very low wind output, at times only about 160 megawatts, contributing to higher prices. Conversely, from Wednesday onwards, strong wind power production will help keep prices notably low for the rest of the week.
