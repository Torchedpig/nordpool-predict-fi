The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage. The outage began on 1 March 2025 at 03:00 and is forecasted to end on 2 May 2025 at 02:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as limited training data is available during such outages.

Electricity price forecasts show clear variations over the coming days. The weekend presents the week's lowest prices, with the average price on **Saturday** and **Sunday** remaining below one cent per kilowatt-hour. Both days will also see negative electricity prices for several hours, particularly on Sunday afternoon between 14:00 and 16:00, when prices may drop as low as -1.4 cents. This means consumers could be paid for electricity usage during those hours.

Prices will rise moderately at the start of the week, but will remain reasonable. On **Monday**, the average daily price increases slightly to 1.8 cents, with the highest prices of around 5.6 cents expected at approximately 09:00. **Tuesday**, however, stands out clearly from other days, with an average price rising to 4.6 cents and a daily maximum of 8.2 cents between 08:00 and 10:00. Tuesday's higher prices are explained by the low minimum wind power production, dropping to 1201 megawatts‚Äîthe week's lowest level.

On **Wednesday**, prices will decrease slightly, with an average daily price of 2.9 cents and peak prices slightly above seven cents in the evening, around 20:00‚Äì22:00. On **Thursday**, prices remain below four cents on average, but there is a significant risk of price spikes reaching up to 10 cents during individual hours, particularly around 08:00. This risk is associated with concurrently low wind power production.

On **Friday**, electricity demand may be somewhat lower than usual due to a public holiday, potentially lowering prices. The day's forecasted average price is 2.2 cents, and prices are not expected to exceed 6.5 cents, despite wind power production being somewhat lower than earlier in the week.
