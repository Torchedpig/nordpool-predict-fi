Next week's electricity price forecast highlights **Friday**, when the average price will rise to 11.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. Price fluctuations for the day will be significant, with the lowest price at 1.5 cents and the highest reaching up to 26.7 cents. The risk of price spikes could drive individual hourly prices even higher, potentially up to 30‚Äì40 cents. The highest prices are expected around the morning hours, approximately between 7 and 9 AM. A key factor behind this price surge is the low minimum production of wind power during the morning.

On **Saturday**, the market situation will change significantly. The average price will drop below two cents, with negative hourly prices appearing during the day, the lowest at -1.7 cents. Wind power generation will be abundant, explaining the low price development. However, a risk of price spikes still exists, potentially raising hourly prices up to 10 cents. Possible price peaks could occur around 9 PM.

On **Sunday**, prices will remain moderate, at an average of 3.5 cents, though hourly prices may approach zero or slightly negative levels. The risk of price spikes could raise peak prices to around 10 cents. Sunday's highest price, according to the forecast, will occur around midnight between 12 and 2 AM, rising above seven cents.

At the beginning of the week, **Monday** and **Tuesday** will show more stable price levels. Monday's average price will settle slightly above four cents without significant fluctuations. Tuesday will see slightly higher prices than Monday, with an average around 5 cents and a maximum price reaching 10 cents. A risk of price spikes on Tuesday could momentarily push prices even higher.

During midweek, **Wednesday** and **Thursday** will offer very affordable rates for electricity users. Wednesday's average price will be just half a cent, and on Thursday the average will turn negative, around -1 cent. High wind power production supports these days' low price levels. Thursday is a public holiday, potentially lowering electricity demand and further pushing prices downward.
