*Electricity market prices are expected to fluctuate significantly in the coming days: the first half of the week will see higher price levels, but as the weekend and next week approach, prices are forecast to fall, especially on Sunday and Tuesday as wind power increases and demand decreases.*

A maintenance outage is underway at the Loviisa 2 nuclear power plant, which began on 4 May 2025 at 17:00 and is expected to end on 8 May 2025 at 12:00. This outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecasts, as there is limited training data available for such maintenance periods.

The forecast was updated on Wednesday at 12:05.

As the weekend approaches, electricity price expectations show clear variation. **Thursday**'s forecast puts the average price at 6.2 cents, the highest level of the week. The maximum price for the day may reach up to 11.2 cents, with a risk of spikes up to 20 cents for individual hours, especially in the early morning from 0–2 and evening from 8–10. Wind power production is at a low level on Thursday, which partially explains the higher price.

**Friday**'s price level remains close to Thursday: the average price is 6.1 cents, and the maximum is 8.5 cents. There is also a potential for spikes up to 20 cents for individual hours, particularly during the morning and evening peak periods. Wind power production remains below one thousand megawatts, supporting the higher price expectation.

On **Saturday**, the price drops noticeably: the average falls to 4.2 cents, with intraday variation from 2.7 to 6.0 cents. Individual hourly spikes may reach up to 10 cents. Wind power output is still on the low side but slightly higher than on Friday.

**Sunday** is a public holiday, and electricity demand is expected to be lower than usual. As a result, the average price remains at 2.4 cents, and the lowest price for the day hovers near zero. However, the maximum price rises to 5.7 cents. There is also a 10 cent spike risk for individual hours, especially during the late morning and early evening.

Next **Monday**, the price level rises slightly from the weekend: the average is 3.5 cents, and the maximum reaches 8.1 cents. Spikes of around 10 cents per hour are possible. Wind power production increases after the weekend.

On **Tuesday**, the price remains moderate, with an average of 2.2 cents and a maximum of 7.4 cents. No spike risk is indicated for this day. Wind power production rises clearly to higher levels.

The week ends on **Wednesday**, when the average price is 2.3 cents and the daily range is 0.5–4.7 cents. For individual hours, spikes up to 10 cents are possible. Wind power output remains at a good level.

The week's price trend is marked by higher average and maximum prices on Thursday and Friday, coinciding with low wind power and the risk of price spikes during certain hours. From Saturday onward, price levels drop quickly, with Sunday and Tuesday seeing the lowest price expectations. The Sunday public holiday reduces demand and is clearly reflected in the price level.
