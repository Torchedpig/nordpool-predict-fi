During the upcoming week, the market price of electricity will vary significantly from day to day. On **Thursday**, the average electricity price will be negative, around -0.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. At its lowest, the price will drop considerably, reaching as low as -2.5 cents, and even at its highest, it will remain around one cent.

On **Friday**, the average price will rise somewhat from Thursday, settling around 1.3 cents. However, the price variation within the day will be considerable, as electricity will cost as little as -1.3 cents at its cheapest and reach as high as 9.1 cents per kilowatt-hour at its peak. The risk of price spikes will be high on Friday, especially during the morning hours between 8:00 and 10:00, when the price could approach nine cents. This is partly due to very low minimum wind production, dropping below 800 megawatts.

During the weekend, **Saturday** will be affordable, with an average price of just 0.1 cents. On Sunday, prices will rise slightly, averaging 2.3 cents. On Sunday, price spikes may occur between 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning, with a forecasted maximum price of 7.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. At the same time, minimum wind power production will be low, only 729 MW, explaining the price increase.

At the beginning of next week, prices will remain moderate. On **Monday**, the average price will be 2.2 cents, while on Tuesday it will decrease again, reaching only 0.4 cents. Tuesday's prices will be among the lowest of the week, second only to Thursday, with the highest price just under three cents. On **Wednesday**, the average electricity price will rise slightly again, reaching approximately 2.6 cents, but the price variation during the day will be significant. The risk of price spikes on Wednesday will be high, particularly between 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning, when the forecasted maximum price is as high as 12.5 cents, and wind power production will drop to around 1076 MW at its lowest.

Throughout the week, electricity prices will mostly remain moderate, but on certain days and hours, prices could rise significantly higher. Electricity users should pay particular attention to these price spikes on Friday and Wednesday mornings.
