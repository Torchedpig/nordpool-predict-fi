*Next week, electricity market prices are set to fluctuate significantly: the start of the week will bring occasional spikes and higher prices, but towards the end of the week, lower and even negative prices will become more common as wind power production increases.*

Clear differences in electricity price forecasts will be seen during the week. **On Saturday** and **Sunday**, prices will remain well above four cents, but midweek, average prices are expected to drop significantly. Especially **on Monday**, the average price will rise to 6.4 cents, with the day's highest hourly price reaching 19.2¢—the week’s peak. This is particularly explained by wind power production dropping to 592 megawatts at minimum on Monday, which is notably lower than on other days and helps explain the exceptionally high hourly price.

**Sunday** is a public holiday, which will be reflected in more moderate prices for the second day of the weekend. The average price will settle at 5.2 cents, and at its lowest, electricity may be available for 1.4 cents. On this day as well, there will be individual hours with price peaks in the morning, though the price level will remain clearly lower than on Monday. **On Saturday** and **Sunday**, there is a risk of hourly price spikes: Saturday’s highest price is expected between 8:00 and 10:00, and Sunday’s morning peak occurs around 6:00–8:00.

From midweek onwards, electricity price expectations will become significantly more affordable. **On Wednesday**, **Thursday**, and **Friday**, the average price will remain below two cents, with the lowest hourly prices even turning negative. For example, Thursday’s lowest price will be -1.0 cents and Friday’s -0.5 cents, meaning that, for some hours, consumers will effectively be paid to use electricity. This trend is influenced by much higher wind power production on these days, especially on Thursday and Friday, when average wind power exceeds 2,800 megawatts.

**On Tuesday**, the average price drops to five cents, and there will still be some individual higher hourly prices within the day, but from Wednesday onwards, the price level will stabilize at a very low level. Price fluctuations diminish towards the end of the week, and no exceptional price spikes are expected on Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday.

After the weekend, the electricity market will shift into a phase where stronger wind power production pushes prices exceptionally low. The cheapest moments of the week are expected during the night hours of Thursday and Friday, when negative hourly prices are possible.
