In the upcoming week, electricity prices are expected to vary notably from day to day. Price fluctuations will be especially prominent on **Wednesday**, when the daily average price will reach the week's highest level at 8.2 cents. The same day will also exhibit significant hourly variations: overnight prices will drop below three cents, but around 10:00 in the morning prices will rise above 14 ¢. During these hours (between 9:00 and 11:00), there is a significant risk of individual price spikes that may climb as high as 20–30 cents.

**Monday** and **Tuesday** prices will remain clearly lower at an average below four cents. On Tuesday, negative hourly prices will appear overnight between 2:00 and 4:00, dropping as low as -1.7 cents.

On Thursday and Friday, average prices will remain moderate, around three to four cents. Both days' prices will be relatively stable, without significant extremes, and no risk of price spikes is forecast for these days.

During the weekend, there will be a clear difference in electricity price levels. On **Saturday**, the daily average price will remain very low, around one cent, and negative hourly prices will be seen in the afternoon between 13:00 and 16:00. Conversely, on **Sunday**, the average price will rise above six cents, and in the evening (between 19:00 and 21:00), there is a risk of price spikes up to 20 cents.

The forecast for next **Monday** indicates an average price slightly below eight cents. A heightened risk is also forecast for this day, meaning hourly prices might momentarily rise up to 20 cents.

Overall, the week's price development will offer a wide range of electricity prices, from inexpensive and even negative prices to higher-priced hours, particularly on Wednesday and Sunday. For consumers, this provides opportunities to take advantage of the cheapest hours of electricity consumption, while also being mindful of potentially higher-priced periods.
