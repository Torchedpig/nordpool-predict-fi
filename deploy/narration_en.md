Electricity prices this week will vary considerably depending on the day. The highest price peaks are expected on Tuesday and Thursday, with prices temporarily climbing to relatively high levels. On **Tuesday**, the average electricity price will be 7.7 ¢/kWh, and the maximum daily price could reach as high as 18.4 cents. Tuesday also comes with a notable risk of price spikes, potentially pushing prices during certain hours to above 20–30 cents. The most expensive hours are likely to occur in the morning between 8:00–10:00. Tuesday’s high prices are partly explained by very low wind power production in the morning, temporarily dropping below 700 MW.

In contrast, electricity prices on **Wednesday** will be extremely low. The average price is only 0.3 ¢, and during nighttime hours, prices may even dip into negative territory, down to -1.8 cents. Wednesday’s wind power production will remain exceptionally high, averaging over 6200 MW, strongly supporting low pricing.

On **Thursday**, prices will rise again, averaging around 4.3 cents for the day. Thursday will also experience significant price fluctuations: nighttime prices will become negative (-0.8 ¢), but morning hours (around 8:00–10:00) will again see prices peak to 18.4 cents. There is a risk of even higher price spikes of 10–20 cents during Thursday morning. Wind power production on Thursday morning will be extremely low, under 500 MW, partly contributing to these price spikes.

During the weekend, electricity prices will stabilize. **Friday’s** average price will be about two cents, with overnight prices again dipping negative. On Saturday, prices will be slightly higher, averaging around four cents, with a small risk of price spikes reaching up to 10 cents during the day. **Sunday’s** average price is very low, about two cents, and the day will also feature minimum prices near zero.

Next **Monday**, prices will again rise slightly, averaging around 4.7 cents. The day's highest prices will occur in the morning between approximately 8:00–10:00, when prices could surpass 11 cents.
