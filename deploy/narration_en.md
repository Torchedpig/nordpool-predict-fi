In the coming week, electricity prices on the spot market will vary considerably from day to day. Clear differences are apparent in prices, with **Thursday** standing out due to its highest average price for the week. On Thursday, the average electricity price will be 8.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. Additionally, there is a risk of price spikes on Thursday, potentially pushing prices up to 20‚Äì30 ¬¢ during individual hours. Prices are forecasted to peak Thursday evening between 18:00‚Äì20:00, reaching approximately 12‚Äì14 cents per kilowatt-hour.

**Friday** will also have higher-than-normal prices, with an average daily price of 6.6 cents. The highest prices on Friday will occur in the morning between 07:00‚Äì09:00, briefly exceeding 15 cents. There is a significant risk of price spikes on Friday as well, potentially climbing as high as 20‚Äì30 cents per kilowatt-hour.

On **Tuesday**, prices will rise again, averaging 6.4 cents, with maximum prices exceeding 11 cents. Tuesday also carries a risk of price spikes, potentially reaching up to 20 cents momentarily.

The cheapest days of the week are **Saturday** and **Sunday**, when average electricity prices remain clearly below one cent. On both days, prices will occasionally become negative overnight. Saturday‚Äôs lowest price will be -0.7 cents, while Sunday‚Äôs lowest price will dip even further to -0.9 cents.

Wind power generation will fluctuate significantly throughout the week, partly explaining the variations in prices. Especially on Thursday and Friday, low wind power minimums below 400 MW contribute to high peak prices and increased risk of price spikes. Over the weekend, abundant wind power availability will clearly reflect in lower electricity prices.
