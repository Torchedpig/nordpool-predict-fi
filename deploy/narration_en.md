Electricity prices on the power exchange will vary greatly during the upcoming week. Prices will peak on **Monday**, when the day's average price is expected to be 9.4 ¢/kWh. During the morning hours, electricity prices may rise significantly. Between 8:00 and 10:00, the price may even exceed 25 cents per kilowatt-hour. The risk of price spikes will be considerable.

On **Tuesday**, the price level will clearly stabilize compared to Monday. The day's average price is expected to be below five cents, but individual price peaks may still occur, especially during the morning hours. Between 8:00 and 10:00, prices may reach up to 14.6 cents.

Midweek, prices will fall to very affordable levels. On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, the average electricity price will remain below one cent. Both days will also experience negative prices; early Wednesday morning, the price is expected to drop as low as -0.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. High wind power production largely explains the very low prices during these days.
