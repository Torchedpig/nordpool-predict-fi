During the coming week, electricity market prices will vary notably from day to day. At the start of the week, especially on **Tuesday**, large price fluctuations will occur, with rates ranging widely from 0.1 cents up to over 17 cents per kilowatt-hour. Tuesday will have the week's widest price range, with the highest prices occurring in the morning between 8:00 and 10:00. On Tuesday, the risk of price spikes is high, and hourly prices may rise to as high as 20‚Äì30 ¬¢ for brief periods.

The week's lowest prices will occur on **Wednesday**, when the average electricity price will be only 0.2 cents. Wednesday will also see the week's lowest single-hour price, dropping as low as negative 1.4 cents between 3:00 and 5:00 in the early morning. On **Friday**, prices will also be low, with the daily average around one cent per kilowatt-hour, and prices dipping nearly two cents below zero during the early morning hours.

Thursday's average price will also remain moderate, at 3.3 ¬¢. However, Thursday morning will experience a temporary increase above 13 cents, significantly higher than the maximum prices on Wednesday and Friday. Heading into the weekend, prices will rise slightly: **Saturday** will see an average price of 4.4 ¬¢, and **Sunday** around five cents per kilowatt-hour. Moreover, both Saturday and Sunday carry a slight risk of price spikes, potentially pushing hourly prices momentarily up to 10 cents.

Wind power production will vary considerably during the coming week. Wednesday will feature abundant wind power, averaging over 6300 MW, explaining the day's exceptionally low prices. Conversely, on Sunday, average wind power production will remain low, under 1700 MW, potentially contributing to higher daily price levels.

Towards the end of the period, prices will stabilize again, and next Monday's average electricity price will remain moderate at approximately 2.6 cents. The week's highest price fluctuations will occur early in the week, with Tuesday particularly standing out due to its price sensitivity.
