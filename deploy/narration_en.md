The price forecast for exchange electricity for the coming week looks quite variable. On **Thursday**, the price will rise significantly higher than on other days. The average price for Thursday is expected to be 14.8 ¬¢/kWh, and the highest price of the day could rise to 20.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. However, there is a risk of a price spike, and prices for individual hours could rise as high as 30-60 cents. The most likely times for high prices are in the morning between 7-9 am and in the evening between 6-8 pm. This is partly due to the fact that wind power production will remain very low on Thursday, with a daily minimum of only 108 MW.

On **Friday**, price expectations are already significantly lower, with an average price of 8.2 ¬¢/kWh. However, the maximum price on Friday could rise to 15.5 cents, and there is still a risk of price spikes, with prices potentially rising to 20-30 cents during individual hours. Price spikes would most likely occur during the morning (7-9 am) and early evening (5-7 pm) hours.

Over the weekend, the price of electricity will fall significantly. On **Saturday**, the average price will remain at 2.3 cents per kilowatt-hour, and on **Sunday** the price will fall to a very affordable 0.9 cents. On Sunday, it is even possible that the price of electricity will momentarily fall below zero, to minus half a cent, during the early morning hours of 4-6 am. The low prices at the weekend will be partly explained by abundant wind power, with an average of 4403 MW of wind power available on Saturday and 4635 MW on Sunday.

At the beginning of next week, on **Monday**, **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, the price of exchange electricity will remain at an affordable level. Average prices will range from 2.5 cents to 3.9 cents per kilowatt-hour. On all three days, there will be plenty of wind power available, which will help to keep prices down. Tuesday and Wednesday's average temperatures will be above zero.
