Electricity prices for the upcoming week will show notable fluctuations. Particularly mid-week stands out with significantly higher average prices and temporary price spikes.

At the beginning of the week, prices will remain moderate. On **Sunday** and **Monday**, average prices will be affordable, staying below three cents per kilowatt-hour. Overnight and morning hours on Sunday will even feature negative prices, as low as -1.0 cents. This is partly due to public holidays, which typically lower electricity demand.

Prices will turn upwards on **Tuesday**, with the average price rising to 6.6 cents and peak hourly prices potentially soaring to 20–30 cents. The risk of price spikes on Tuesday is particularly focused on the evening, between 19:00–21:00, where the forecast already shows levels above 15 cents even without risk factors considered.

On **Wednesday**, the average electricity price will reach the week's highest level, at 9.1 cents per kilowatt-hour. However, price fluctuations on Wednesday will be somewhat more stable compared to Tuesday, though the highest hourly prices will appear in the morning between 07:00–09:00. There is also a risk of price spikes on Wednesday, with individual hourly prices potentially rising to around 20 cents.

**Thursday** will continue on similar lines as Wednesday, with an average price of 8.2 cents and maximum prices exceeding 15 cents. On Thursday, the risk of temporary price spikes will again be substantial, particularly during the morning hours between 07:00–09:00.

On Friday, prices will fall significantly, with the average price dropping to only 1.6 cents. Early Friday morning hours will again feature negative electricity prices, the lowest being -0.2 cents. **Saturday** will see a slight rebound, with the average price climbing to four cents. There is also a small risk of price spikes on Saturday, but only up to about 10 cents.
