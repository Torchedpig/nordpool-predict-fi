The price of electricity on the power exchange is expected to fluctuate during the coming week. On Wednesday, the price will rise, but towards the end of the week and next week, the price level will fall significantly.

On **Wednesday**, the average price of electricity will rise to 9.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. The highest price of the day will rise to 23.1 cents, partly due to the severe frost, as the average daily temperature is predicted to be -9.3 degrees Celsius. The low amount of wind power, at a minimum of only 1101 MW, may also contribute to the higher price. The highest price will occur in the morning between 7-9 AM. At night, the price will fall significantly cheaper, even below two cents.

On **Thursday**, the average price will fall to 5.9 cents. The price will remain below ten cents for most of the day, except for the morning hours. At its lowest, the price will be less than one cent. The frost will continue as severe as on Wednesday.

On **Friday**, the average price of electricity will fall to 3.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. The price will remain quite low throughout the day and will not rise above 6.5 cents at any time. The average temperature on Friday is -3.4 degrees Celsius.

During the weekend, electricity on the power exchange will be cheap. The average price on **Saturday** will be 2.9 Â¢ and on **Sunday** only 1.7 Â¢. On Sunday, the price will even fall slightly below zero (-0.1 Â¢) in the evening at 9 PM. On Saturday, less wind power is available than on other days, but on Sunday, wind power is predicted to increase.

Next **Monday**, the average price of electricity will fall to 0.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. The price will even go down to -0.8 cents during the night hours. Very high wind power production, up to 5798 MW, is predicted for Monday, which partly explains the low price.

Next **Tuesday**, the average price of electricity will rise to 5.4 cents. The lowest price of the day will fall below zero (-0.4 Â¢), but the highest price will rise to 11.3 cents per kilowatt-hour.
