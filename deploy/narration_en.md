The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is undergoing scheduled maintenance from 1 March 2025 at 03:00. The maintenance is expected to end on 28 April 2025 at 01:00. This maintenance break may affect forecast accuracy, as training data from maintenance periods is limited.

Electricity prices will vary considerably depending on the day in the coming week. Clearly the week's highest average price is forecasted for **Friday**, with an average price of 11.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. Friday will also see the week's highest hourly price, which could surpass 24 cents in the morning hours between 7â€“9. Additionally, Friday carries a significant risk of individual price spikes, potentially raising prices as high as 30â€“50 cents per kilowatt-hour.

During the weekend, electricity price expectations will clearly decrease from Fridayâ€™s peak. **Saturday** average price will be 6.4 cents. Saturday is among the week's most inexpensive days, though hourly prices could still momentarily rise to as high as 20â€“30 cents. The lowest prices will be early Saturday morning, dipping below one cent between 4â€“6 AM.

On **Sunday**, the price will rise slightly higher again, with an average price of 9.1 cents. Individual hourly prices on Sunday could exceed 16 cents in the morning hours between 7â€“9. Additionally, Sunday carries the risk of temporary price spikes that could push prices up to 20â€“40 cents.

At the beginning of next week, electricity prices will continue to decrease. **Monday** average will be 7.3 cents and **Tuesday** only 5.3 cents. Monday still carries a risk of price spikes where hourly rates could momentarily rise as high as 20â€“30 cents. On Tuesday, the similar spike risk is lower but still possible, with hourly rates potentially reaching 20 cents.

The cheapest days of the week will be **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, when prices fall to exceptionally low levels. Wednesday's average price will be 3.4 cents, and hourly prices may even become negative, dropping as low as -0.4 cents late in the evening between 8â€“10 PM. **Thursday** is a public holiday, reducing electricity demand below normal levels. Thursday's average price will be just 0.9 cents, with the lowest forecasted hourly price dipping to -1.4 cents during the afternoon hours.
