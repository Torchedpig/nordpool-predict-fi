There will be some fluctuations in electricity prices throughout the week. However, the overall price level will remain affordable, and no particularly high average prices are forecasted for any day. Daily averages will mostly remain below four cents per kilowatt-hour.

On **Tuesday**, the average electricity price will be very low, only 0.2 cents. During the night and early morning, prices will briefly drop into negative territory, reaching as low as -1.2 cents between 03:00 and 06:00. The highest price of the day, 2.8 cents, will occur in the morning between 08:00 and 10:00.

The situation on **Wednesday** will differ slightly from other weekdays. The daily average price will rise to 2.4 cents, and the highest single price of the week, up to 6.5 cents, will be recorded in the morning between 08:00 and 10:00. Wind power production is expected to be relatively low at that time, partly explaining the higher maximum price. Consequently, there is a risk of brief price spikes during Wednesday morning.

On **Saturday**, the average electricity price will rise to the highest level of the week, 3.6 cents. During Saturday morning between 07:00 and 09:00, the price could briefly peak at up to 7.2 cents. Again, wind power production will remain relatively low, increasing the likelihood of temporary price spikes during certain hours.

On **Sunday**, the price level will drop considerably again, with the daily average close to zero. Negative prices will occur on Sunday afternoon between 12:00 and 17:00, with prices dropping as low as -1.7 cents.

On other days of the week, such as **Thursday**, **Friday**, and next **Monday**, prices will remain moderate without notable fluctuations.
