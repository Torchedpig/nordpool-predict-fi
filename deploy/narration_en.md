The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is undergoing maintenance. This outage began on March 1, 2025, at 03:00 and is forecasted to end on May 2, 2025, at 02:00. The maintenance outage may affect forecast accuracy, as limited historical data is available during such maintenance periods.

In the coming days, electricity price expectations will show significant daily fluctuations. Prices will begin high at the start of the period, but fall sharply heading into the weekend. Thursday will see large intraday price variations. The lowest prices, between 1.7â€“3 cents, will occur overnight from 00:00 to 02:00. However, prices will rise significantly in the evening, peaking around 18:00â€“20:00 at as high as 27.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. Thursday's average price will be high, at 11.3 cents.

On **Friday**, electricity prices will also fluctuate notably. The cheapest electricity will be available late at night, when prices will fall below one cent. During the day, prices will peak around 08:00 at 17.5 cents. Friday's average price will be 9.3 cents, with a high risk of additional price spikes. Prices during individual hours could rise as high as 20â€“40 cents.

Over the weekend, the situation will change notably. On **Saturday**, the average electricity price will dip into negative figures (-0.1 cents) and remain low throughout the day, reaching as low as -1.4 cents. On **Sunday**, prices will remain exceptionally low, with an average of 0.1 cents and a minimum of -1.8 cents. Thus, electricity prices on both weekend days will be unusually inexpensive.

Early next week, prices will rise somewhat again. On **Monday** and **Tuesday**, average prices will remain moderate, around 3.9 and 3.6 cents respectively. Price variability on these days will be less pronounced compared to Thursday and Friday, and no price spikes are expected.

Next **Wednesday**, the average electricity price will again rise to a higher level, at 8.9 cents. Peak prices will occur around 08:00, reaching 13.7 cents, with a risk of price spikes. Individual hourly prices may reach as high as 20 cents.

The overall picture for the week will be dominated by significant price differences across days and hours. The exceptionally low prices over the weekend will clearly contrast with the high price spikes seen on Thursday and Friday.
