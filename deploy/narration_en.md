In the price forecasts for the week, **Tuesday** particularly stands out with an expected higher average price of 10.4 ¢/kWh, and the maximum price rises to even 17 ¢. This day is also noted for a high risk of price spikes, which can raise individual hourly prices to the 30-40 ¢ level. Tuesday's forecasted minimum wind power production, 814 MW, is significantly lower than on other days, which partly explains the higher price level.

**Wednesday** is also forecasted to have higher prices, 11.3 ¢/kWh, with a maximum price that can rise to 15.8 ¢. This day also carries a high risk of price spikes. Wind power production remains low, which may contribute to rising prices.

The cheapest day of the week is expected to be **Saturday**, with an average price estimated at 5.0 ¢/kWh. This is explained by higher wind power production ranging from 2795 MW to 4595 MW. The weather on Saturday is cool, but strong wind power production helps keep prices moderate.

Other days of the week, such as **Thursday**, **Friday**, and **Monday**, appear to remain relatively stable in terms of price levels, without significant deviations. On these days, the average price ranges between 7.5 and 7.9 ¢/kWh. Wind power production is at a normal level on these days and does not have a significant impact on the price.

Expected temperatures for the week remain within normal winter conditions and are not expected to have a significant impact on electricity prices.
