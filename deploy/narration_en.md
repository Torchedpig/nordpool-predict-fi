The price of electricity on the exchange will be variable over the coming week. There will be both more expensive and cheaper days ahead.

On **Tuesday**, the average price of electricity on the exchange will settle at 10.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. During the day, the price will vary from 2.6 cents to 15.7 cents. However, on Tuesday there is a high risk of price spikes, with prices for individual hours potentially rising to 30-40 cents. The price spike is likely to occur in the early evening, around 6-8 pm. The higher price is due to the low production of wind power, which will remain at a minimum of 836 megawatts during the day.

On **Wednesday**, the average price of electricity on the exchange will rise to 15.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, the highest of the week. The price will peak at 20.8 cents, but could fall to a low of 9.3 cents. Wednesday has a very high risk of price spikes, even 40-60 cents for single hours. The most likely time for a price spike is in the morning at 7-9 am. On Wednesday, wind power production will remain very low, averaging only 363 megawatts. During the day, wind power will be available at a minimum of only 94 megawatts.

**Thursday's** average price will be 12.6 ¢/kWh. The price will be at its lowest at 7.2 ¢ and at its highest at 17.7 ¢.
