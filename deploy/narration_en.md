*During the upcoming week, electricity exchange prices will fluctuate significantly, ranging from negative values up to over 13 cents; notably, Tuesday and Sunday may experience high price spikes, and the maintenance outage at Olkiluoto 3 could affect forecast accuracy.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant will be on a maintenance outage from 1 March 2025 at 03:00 until 2 May 2025 at 02:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of price forecasts, as training data from periods of such outages is limited.

Forecast updated on Monday at 09:00.

During the coming week, electricity prices are expected to vary significantly each day. The daily average prices will range from inexpensive levels below one cent to around five cents per kilowatt-hour. Daily price fluctuations will be notable, with prices occasionally dipping into negative territory and rising to over 13 cents at peak times.

The week's highest single price spike is anticipated on **Tuesday** evening between 19:00 and 21:00, when prices could peak above 13 cents. Moreover, Tuesday carries a significant risk of even higher price spikes, potentially reaching as high as 10‚Äì20 cents on individual hours. This is partially explained by the temporarily low wind power production.

On **Thursday** and **Monday**, daily average prices will slightly exceed four cents, with peak prices around 10 cents. These days may also see temporary higher price spikes, possibly reaching up to about 10 cents.

On **Friday** and **Saturday**, price levels will remain low, especially on Saturday with an average price of only 0.4 cents. On both days, electricity prices will also turn negative, with Saturday reaching as low as -1.6 cents. This indicates that electricity generation occasionally surpasses demand, causing prices to drop below zero.

Another day with a risk of notable price spikes will be **Sunday**, when the daily maximum price is forecast to reach around eight cents. Sunday may also experience price spikes of up to around 10 cents. The temporarily low minimum wind power production on Sunday might explain these price peaks.

The week concludes on **Monday**, which is a public holiday. This may reduce energy demand and thus moderate price levels. However, the expected daily average price will still exceed four cents, and price spikes could occur.
