In the coming week's electricity price forecast, **Friday** stands out noticeably, as the average electricity price will rise to 2.3 cents. This increase is mainly due to weak wind power production, averaging only 1718 megawatts throughout the day. Since the minimum wind power output at nine in the morning is only 668 MW, individual price spikes may occur particularly in the morning hours between approximately 8–10 am. The highest hourly price predicted for Friday is 10.0 cents.

The most affordable day of the week will be **Sunday**, when the average electricity price will drop slightly negative, to -0.3 cents. On Sunday, prices will be lowest during the daytime, especially from late morning to afternoon between 10 am and 4 pm, when prices will range from -1.8 to -1.4 cents.

On Thursday, Saturday, and Wednesday, average electricity prices will also remain close to zero, with moderate fluctuations. On Saturday, price levels will stay negative for most of the day, but briefly rise above two cents around 8–9 am.

On Monday, prices will remain moderate, with an average slightly above one cent. Price variation that day will be smaller than other days, with minimum prices at 0.2 cents and maximum at 2.8 cents. On Tuesday, the price level will also remain close to zero, although prices will briefly rise above four cents around 9 am in the morning.

Overall, apart from Friday's individual price spikes, electricity prices for the upcoming week are forecasted to remain generally inexpensive. Negative prices will be common especially during night and daytime hours on multiple days.
