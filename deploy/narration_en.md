The price of exchange electricity will fluctuate during the coming week. The cheapest days will be **Tuesday**, when the average price remains at 4 cents per kilowatt-hour, and **Monday**, when the average price is 5.6 ¢/kWh. On Monday morning, the price may even dip below zero.

The most expensive day will be **Friday**, when the average price of exchange electricity rises to 10.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. Friday's maximum price, 15.8 ¢, will occur during the morning and afternoon hours. Friday's price is raised by the low wind power production, which is at its lowest at only 1241 MW. In addition, Friday will have a brisk -5.6 degree frost.

Next week's price fluctuations will be at their greatest during Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Especially on **Thursday**, the price may rise to 20 cents during individual hours. The risk of a price spike is greatest in the morning between 7-9 am and in the evening between 5-7 pm. Wind power production on Thursday will remain at a minimum of 1836 megawatts, which partly explains the rise in prices.

On **Friday**, the risk of price spikes is even greater, up to 30-40 cents for individual hours, especially in the morning between 7-9 am and in the evening between 5-7 pm. On **Saturday**, the risk rises to 20 cents between 8-10 am. On **Sunday**, the corresponding risk is 20-30 cents, in the afternoon between 5-7 pm.

This coming weekend, temperatures will drop significantly. Saturday's average temperature will be -7.6 °C and Sunday's -8.7 °C, which will increase electricity consumption and may raise the price.
