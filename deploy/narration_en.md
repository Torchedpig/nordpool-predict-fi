In the coming week, electricity prices will fluctuate significantly. Differences in daily average price forecasts are substantial. Price variations will peak on weekdays, whereas weekend price expectations will remain very low.

The week's highest prices will occur on **Tuesday**, when the average electricity price will reach 10 cents, and hourly price forecasts may rise even over 17 cents. On Tuesday, the risk of price spikes will be high, and individual hourly prices could rise to between 20 and 40 cents. Tuesday's highest prices will likely occur during the morning hours between around 9:00 and 11:00. A key reason for Tuesday's high peak prices is a noticeable drop in wind power production; at times wind power will be as low as 695 MW.

On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, prices will clearly decrease compared to Tuesday. Wednesday's average price settles at 4.5 cents, and on Thursday at 4.2 cents. Negative hourly prices are also anticipated on Thursday afternoon around 16:00, indicating abundant wind power supply.

**Friday** will see the cheapest electricity of the week. The day's average price is extremely low, just 0.1 cents, with prices ranging slightly negative, from -0.8 cents up to a maximum of 1.4 cents. The cheapest hours will occur on Friday afternoon around 14:00-16:00, when electricity will be virtually free. The exceptionally low prices on Friday are largely due to very high wind power production, consistently remaining above 5300 MW throughout the day.

Weekend prices will also remain very low. **Saturday** and **Sunday** will see several hours with negative prices, especially during nighttime and early morning hours. On Sunday afternoon, between approximately 12:00 and 14:00, prices could fall as low as -1.2 cents.

Next **Monday**, electricity prices will again rise significantly from the weekend's levels. The average price will climb to 6.6 cents, and the maximum price will exceed 16 cents around 21:00. On Monday, the risk of price spikes is high, and hourly prices could rise even up to 20-30 cents.
