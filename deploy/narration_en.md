*Electricity prices will vary significantly in the coming week, with Monday seeing peaks up to 50 cents; however, abundant wind power production later in the week will push prices close to zero and occasionally negative.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is undergoing a maintenance outage. During the outage, the plant's available capacity is 0 MW, and its availability rate is at 0.0 percent. The maintenance started on 1 March 2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on 2 May 2025 at 02:00. This outage may affect the accuracy of price forecasts, as training data during maintenance periods is limited.

Electricity price forecasts for the coming week show significant daily variations. Prices will vary notably throughout the week, with expectations of declining prices toward the weekend.

The highest average prices of the week are forecasted for **Monday**, when the average price could rise to 11.6 cents. Monday also carries the week's highest risk of price spikes, which could momentarily send electricity prices as high as 30‚Äì50 cents per kilowatt-hour in individual hours. The most likely timing for these price spikes will be Monday morning between 08:00‚Äì10:00 and evening between 19:00‚Äì21:00. Monday‚Äôs high prices will be significantly influenced by low wind power production, dropping to a minimum of 234 MW. This low production notably drives up electricity prices, especially during peak hours.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, there will also be some elevated risk of higher prices, although average prices remain more moderate around 7 cents. On Tuesday, price spikes could reach briefly up to 20 cents, possibly during the early morning hours between 00:00‚Äì02:00, when wind power production is at its lowest. Wednesday's risk of price spikes is similar, most likely occurring in the late morning between 09:00‚Äì11:00.

Thursday will already be clearly more affordable. The average price is projected to drop to 2.3 cents, with even negative hourly prices appearing during the day, bottoming out at -0.6 cents between 14:00‚Äì16:00. The reason for the price drop is abundant wind power production, averaging over 4400 MW.

On Friday and Saturday, prices will fall even further. Friday's average price will be only 0.3 cents, and negative prices will again occur overnight. Strong wind power production, averaging over 5600 MW on Friday and over 4200 MW on Saturday, will keep prices extremely low.

The week concludes on Sunday with stable and moderate prices around 4.9 cents. No significant price fluctuations are expected during the day.
