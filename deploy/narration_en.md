The electricity price forecast for the coming week clearly shows daily fluctuations. The cheapest days will be **Thursday** and **Wednesday**, when the average electricity price remains negative. On Thursday, the week's lowest average price of -0.9 cents is expected, with nighttime prices dropping as low as -2.7 cents. On Wednesday, price levels will similarly stay low, between -2.1 and 0.2 cents.

On **Friday**, prices are expected to rise significantly compared to the start of the week. The average price will be around one cent, but prices can rise to over six cents during the morning hours between 8:00 and 10:00. Friday morning's highest prices are explained by low wind power production, dipping to a minimum of only 1180 megawatts. This situation creates a risk for isolated price spikes on Friday.

During the weekend, electricity prices will vary. On **Saturday**, the average price will remain low, slightly negative on average, but on **Sunday**, prices will rise again. Sunday's average price will be the week's highest, about 1.2 cents. During individual morning hours between 8:00 and 10:00, the price is forecasted to rise as high as 5.7 cents due to low wind power production. Sunday's wind power output will fall to a minimum of only 1069 megawatts, explaining the price increase and creating a risk for isolated price spikes.

At the beginning of next week, on **Monday** and **Tuesday**, prices will settle into moderate levels. On Monday, the average price will be about one cent, and on Tuesday 0.3 cents. Price fluctuations on these days will be minor, not exceeding four cents.
