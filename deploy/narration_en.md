The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage. The outage started on 1.3.2025 at 03:00 and the estimated end time is 2.5.2025 at 02:00. The maintenance outage may affect forecast accuracy since training data during outage periods is limited.

At the beginning of the upcoming week, electricity prices will remain moderate. On **Monday** and **Tuesday**, average prices will stay below four cents, yet **Tuesday** will see negative prices during early morning hours. The cheapest moment on Tuesday will occur between 1‚Äì3 AM, when prices drop as low as -1,7 cents. Later in the afternoon and evening, the price will climb to almost ten cents at its highest.

A distinct outlier of the week is **Wednesday**, when the average price will rise above seven cents. The day's price fluctuations will be substantial: the lowest price will be 0,4 cents in the early morning, while during the evening hours between 6‚Äì8 PM, the price will peak at 13 cents. For Wednesday, forecasting models indicate a high risk of price spikes, potentially pushing hourly prices as high as 20‚Äì30 cents.

On **Thursday**, prices will return to more moderate levels, with an average price slightly above three cents. During the day, short periods of near-zero prices will again occur. **Friday** is forecast to be one of the week's cheapest days, averaging just 1,2 cents, and the day's maximum price will only slightly exceed four cents.

During the weekend, prices will remain moderate, although **Saturday** will be slightly more expensive than Friday, averaging just over two cents. On Sunday, a rather remarkable phenomenon is expected, as the daily average price forecast turns negative at -0,3 cents. This means electricity users would on average receive a small compensation for using electricity. Sunday's cheapest hours will occur after noon between 12‚Äì4 PM, when prices will be almost two cents negative.

For next **Monday**, prices are expected to be steady and extremely low, with an average price of only 0,6 cents and no variation throughout the day.
