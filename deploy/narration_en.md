Electricity price expectations will vary significantly over the next week. Electricity will be most expensive on **Wednesday**, when the average daily price is predicted to be 9.7 Â¢/kWh. Wednesday's maximum price, 17.4 Â¢, will occur during the morning hours between 8 and 10. On Wednesday and Thursday, there is a risk that the prices of individual hours will rise significantly higher, even up to 20-40 cents per kilowatt-hour. The most likely time for price spikes is in the morning between eight and ten, and in the evening between six and eight.

The average price for **Thursday**, 8.2 Â¢, is also close to ten cents. The predicted maximum price is 14.1 Â¢/kWh in the morning between eight and ten. The high prices on Wednesday and Thursday are explained by the exceptionally cold weather, as the average daily temperature is -9.3 degrees Celsius. In addition, wind power production will remain at a low level on Wednesday and Thursday. For example, Wednesday's minimum production, 1058 MW, will occur during the afternoon hours.

From **Friday** onwards, the price of electricity will fall significantly. Friday's average price will be 2.8 Â¢, and during the weekend the price will fall even lower. On **Saturday**, the average price will be 1.7 Â¢ and on **Sunday** only 1.1 Â¢. On Sunday, negative hourly prices are also expected: -0.1 Â¢/kWh in the early morning between two and three, and -0.2 Â¢/kWh late in the evening between eleven and twelve.

Next **Monday**, the average price of electricity will be only 0.3 Â¢/kWh. During Monday and the following night, several hours are expected when the price of electricity will fall below zero. The lowest price will be -1.0 Â¢/kWh in the early morning between two and four. The cheap days from Monday onwards are explained by the abundant wind power production. For example, on Monday, wind power will be available at an average of 5559 MW, which is very high.

Next **Tuesday**, the average price of electricity will rise to 6.4 cents per kilowatt-hour, but the price will still be clearly cheaper than on the first two days of the week. Tuesday's maximum price, 11.3 Â¢, will occur in the evening between seven and nine. At that time, wind power production will be at its lowest, 2197 MW, which explains the higher maximum price. On Tuesday, there is a risk that the prices of individual hours will rise higher, up to 20 cents per kilowatt-hour.
