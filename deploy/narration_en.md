Electricity market prices in the coming days will experience considerable fluctuations. The cheapest days occur at the start of the week: **Monday** and **Tuesday** average prices remain below one cent per kilowatt-hour. On Tuesday, the average price might even dip into negative territory (-0.1 Â¢), making electricity clearly negative priced during nighttime and early morning hours. Strong wind production (average wind power exceeding 3000 MW) largely explains these extremely low prices.

Midweek prices will remain low, although they slightly increase. On **Wednesday**, the average price hovers just above zero (0.7 Â¢/kWh). Slightly higher, yet still affordable, will be **Thursday**, with an expected daily average around 2.3 cents. Thursday is a public holiday, which likely reduces electricity demand and could help maintain lower prices. Despite the holiday, individual price spikes remain possible on Thursday evening between 18:00â€“20:00, when prices may rise close to seven cents.

The highest price levels of the week will arrive on **Friday**, when the daily average price rises to approximately 5.1 cents. On Friday, intra-day variations will be significant, with morning hours possibly seeing peaks above 11 cents. Highest price spikes are expected during the morning, around 08:00â€“10:00. Contributing to this is the low wind power production, as Fridayâ€™s wind generation remains well below normal levels (average around 1709 MW, minimum only 1308 MW).

As we move into the weekend, prices will decrease significantly again. On **Saturday**, the average price dips below one cent, with negative prices again possible in the early morning hours. Sunday's prices remain moderate, yet individual price spikes might occur Sunday morning around 08:00â€“10:00, when prices could momentarily exceed eight cents.

Throughout the week, prices will therefore fluctuate considerablyâ€”at times electricity will be nearly free or even negatively priced, while at other moments prices rise clearly above average. From a consumer perspective, closely monitoring intra-day price variations is advisable, as differences during the day can be substantial.
