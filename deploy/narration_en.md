*The beginning of the week brings high electricity prices and risks of price spikes, but from Wednesday onward, prices will fall significantly ‚Äî even dipping into negative ‚Äî due to strong wind power production; the maintenance break at Olkiluoto 3 may affect forecast accuracy.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance break. The outage started on 1 March 2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on 2 May 2025 at 02:00. The maintenance break may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data from periods of maintenance outages is limited.

The forecast was updated on Saturday at 12:00.

Next week's electricity price forecasts will vary significantly. The highest variations will occur early in the week, while from midweek onwards prices will clearly settle to lower levels.

The week's highest average price will occur on **Monday**, when the average electricity price will reach 8.1 cents per kilowatt hour. The week's highest single hourly maximum price (14.2 ¬¢) is also forecasted around 9 am on the same day. Additionally, Monday includes a risk of even higher price spikes of up to 20 cents during individual hours.

On **Tuesday**, substantial price fluctuations will continue. Although the average price will decline to 6.2 cents, prices from 8 to 10 am will still be high, around 12‚Äì14 cents. Tuesday also carries a risk of temporary price spikes reaching up to 20 ¬¢.

From **Wednesday** onward, electricity prices will fall dramatically, even turning negative at times. Wednesday's average price will remain very low, at only 0.7 ¬¢. Negative prices will occur especially during the night and early morning hours, with the lowest price around -0.9 cents.

Low price levels will continue on **Thursday**, **Friday**, and **Saturday**, when average electricity prices will range between 0.3 and 1.6 ¬¢/kWh. On Saturday morning, prices will be particularly low, reaching -2.5 cents. The risk of price spikes on these days is minimal and does not need to be mentioned.

The exceptionally low prices towards the end of the week will largely be explained by abundant wind power production, which will be available in large quantities from Wednesday to Saturday.
