The price of electricity on the exchange will rise tonight, but the average price for **Tuesday** will remain below three cents per kilowatt-hour. Tuesday is the only day of the week when the temperature drops below -8 degrees. As wind power production on Tuesday remains high, the price differences within the day will remain small.

On Wednesday and Thursday, the price of electricity will rise significantly. The average price for **Wednesday** will rise to nearly 12 cents per kilowatt-hour. However, the forecasts for Wednesday and Thursday include a risk of price spikes, which could push the prices of individual hours significantly higher than predicted. On Wednesday, the prices of individual hours could rise up to 30-50 cents, and on Thursday to 20-40 cents per kilowatt-hour.

The risk of price spikes on Wednesday is during the morning hours, around 8-10 AM, when wind power production drops very low, to only about a thousand megawatts. On **Thursday**, the highest peak prices are most likely to occur during the morning hours, around 7-9 AM. The rise in prices on Wednesday and Thursday is also explained by the freezing temperatures. The average temperature on Wednesday and Thursday is -9.3 degrees Celsius.

On **Friday**, the price of electricity will fall again, and the average price for the day is predicted to be 2.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Friday, there will be plenty of wind power available, which will push the price down. The price of electricity will also remain low during the weekend.

The average price for **Saturday** will rise slightly, but will remain below four cents per kilowatt-hour. On Saturday, wind power production will be at a somewhat lower level than on Friday. On **Sunday**, the average price of electricity will fall to zero, and during the night hours, the price may even dip below zero. Next **Monday**, the price will remain close to zero. During the weekend and next Monday, there will be a very large amount of wind power available.
