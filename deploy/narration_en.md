The price of exchange electricity will be low next week. Of the coming days, **Monday's** price expectations are the highest, as the average price for the day is predicted to be 3.7 ¬¢ and at its highest, the price is expected to rise to 9.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. The other days are close to each other in price.

During the weekend, the price of electricity will fall very low. On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, even negative prices are expected. On Saturday, the price is expected to fall below zero in the afternoon between 2 pm and 4 pm, and on Sunday, negative prices may occur in the early morning and around noon. Sunday's average price will remain at only 0.6 cents.

At the beginning of next week, the price of electricity will rise, but will still remain low. The higher prices on Monday may be partly due to the fact that wind power is predicted to be weaker than on other days. After Monday, the price will fall again on Tuesday, and remain fairly stable for the rest of the week.

Between Wednesday and Thursday night, the price will temporarily rise to close to five cents, but will then fall rapidly. Towards the end of the week, the price will remain mostly below three cents, and on Thursday and Friday, even negative prices are again expected at times.
