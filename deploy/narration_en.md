Electricity prices in Finland will experience notable fluctuations in the coming days. Especially **Thursday** and next **Monday** stand out with significantly higher peak prices compared to other days. Thursday's average price is estimated at 4.9 cents per kWh, but in the morning (between 7â€“9), prices will rise considerably, reaching up to 22.5 cents. This is primarily due to low wind power production during morning hours.

On **Friday**, **Saturday**, and **Sunday**, prices will remain moderate. Among these days, Sunday is exceptionally affordable, as the day's average price is expected to be practically zero. Negative prices are anticipated during the weekend, meaning electricity prices will temporarily drop below zero. For instance, on Sunday afternoon and early evening (between 16â€“20), prices are forecasted to be negative.

Starting from next **Monday**, prices will rise again. Monday's average is forecasted at 4.8 cents, with single high-price peaks occurring in the morning between 8â€“10, rising above 13 cents. Additionally, there is a risk of price spikes on Monday, meaning that the price during individual hours might potentially rise up to ten cents higher than currently forecasted.

Similarly, next **Tuesday** prices are predicted to remain around four cents on average, but the day also involves a risk of potential price spikes. Thus, individual hourly prices might increase by up to 10 cents more than the current forecast suggests.

On **Wednesday**, prices will drop again to more moderate levels, with the day's average at 1.2 cents. The price variation throughout Wednesday will be minimal, and there is no risk of price spikes.
