Electricity prices are expected to vary significantly in the coming days. The week's highest prices will occur on **Sunday**, with an average electricity price of 6.4 cents and peak prices exceeding 10 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Sunday, wind power production will occasionally drop very low, to just 700 megawatts, explaining the day's high peak prices. Additionally, there is a risk of individual price spikes on Sunday, potentially pushing prices up to 20 cents, particularly in the morning between about 08:00 and 10:00.

Another somewhat more expensive day will be **Monday**, with an expected average electricity price of 5.3 cents. However, Mondayâ€™s prices will remain more moderate than the previous day, with peak prices not exceeding 9.3 cents. Higher price levels early in the week will quickly stabilize starting from Tuesday, as wind power production significantly increases. On **Tuesday**, the lowest electricity price of the day will even dip slightly negative (-0.8 cents), especially between 16:00 and 18:00.

The week's cheapest electricity prices will occur on **Wednesday**, with an average price of only 0.3 cents. On Wednesday, wind power production will remain very high, keeping electricity prices low. Negative prices will occur during several hours in the early morning and morning hours.

The latter part of the week will see moderate prices, and on **Friday**, the average price will remain at 1.6 cents. Friday will also see some negative hourly prices, especially early in the morning between 03:00 and 05:00.

Overall, notable fluctuations characterize the week's electricity price expectations, with Sunday's high peaks and Wednesdayâ€™s exceptionally low price levels clearly standing out. Consumers should consider these variations in their electricity consumption, especially over the weekend.
