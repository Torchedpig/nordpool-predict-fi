*Electricity prices for the coming week will vary greatly: price peaks exceeding 20 cents are expected on Monday, but from Wednesday onwards, prices will drop significantly thanks to strong wind power production, even reaching negative levels.*

Electricity price forecasts for the week ahead will vary significantly. The most notable day will be **Monday**, when electricity prices are expected to be clearly higher than on other days. The day's average price is expected to reach 9.4 cents per kilowatt-hour, with the highest prices occurring between 8‚Äì10 AM. At that time, prices may exceed 20 cents, and the forecast indicates a significantly elevated risk of price spikes.

On **Tuesday**, price fluctuations may also be large, although the average price will be considerably lower than on Monday, around 4.3¬¢. The day's most expensive hours will be in the morning between 9‚Äì11 AM, when prices may exceed 10¬¢. In the evening, prices are expected to decline significantly, potentially dropping below two cents.

The cheapest days of the week will be from Wednesday to Saturday. On these days, the average electricity price will remain clearly below two cents. On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, negative prices will also occur during several hours, and Thursday's lowest forecasted price is as low as -1.4¬¢. Negative prices indicate that electricity consumers could be paid for consuming electricity during those hours.

The particularly low prices towards the end of the week will result from strong forecasted wind production. Average wind power generation on Wednesday and Thursday will be high‚Äîover 3500 MW on Wednesday and nearly 2800 MW on Thursday. This abundant wind power production will keep electricity price expectations very low on both days.

On **Sunday**, prices will remain moderate, averaging around 2.6 cents, due to lower electricity consumption on the public holiday. Prices are expected to be highest in the morning between 8‚Äì9 AM, when the price may exceed six cents.

Thus, the week's price development will be variable, and especially at the beginning of the week, electricity users should be prepared for sharp price increases. In contrast, towards the end of the week, electricity prices are expected to be especially affordable.
