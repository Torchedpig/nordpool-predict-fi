*Electricity prices in the upcoming week will fluctuate significantly: early in the week, prices will spike during individual hours, but from midweek onwards, electricity prices will drop notably low, occasionally becoming negative, especially due to abundant wind power generation.*

The maintenance outage at Olkiluoto 1 nuclear plant will last from 11.5.2025 at 18:00 until 22.5.2025 at 18:00. The outage may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as training data during maintenance outages is limited.

The upcoming week in the electricity market will be variable. There will be significant price differences between days, with **Monday** notably standing out due to its higher average price (9.2 ¬¢). Single-hour price spikes are also expected on Monday; according to forecasts, the highest peak occurs between 8:00‚Äì10:00, when prices may rise above 22 cents.

On **Tuesday**, price fluctuations will also be notable, although the average price (5.1 ¬¢) will remain clearly below Monday's level. However, there is still a risk of price spikes on Tuesday, particularly in the morning hours between 8:00‚Äì10:00, when prices may reach up to 15 cents. On both days, these fluctuations are partly due to low minimum levels of wind power production, being only 173 MW on Monday and 734 MW on Tuesday.

In the middle of the week, prices will decline significantly. On **Wednesday**, **Thursday**, and **Friday**, the average electricity price will stay very cheap, below one cent. Negative prices will appear during overnight hours on Wednesday and Thursday. For example, during the night leading into Wednesday, the price is forecasted to reach as low as -0.6 cents, and on Thursday morning even down to -1.1 cents. This is partly due to high wind power production, averaging 3559 MW on Wednesday and as much as 3619 MW on Friday.

Over the weekend, prices will remain low. On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, the average prices will stay under one cent. On Sunday, however, prices will fluctuate more significantly than on Saturday, with a slight risk of a price spike forecasted in the morning hours between 8:00‚Äì10:00, potentially rising above five cents.

Thus, the general outlook for the week is dual: the beginning of the week will be significantly higher and more unstable in terms of prices, while from midweek onwards, electricity prices will stay extremely low and occasionally negative.
