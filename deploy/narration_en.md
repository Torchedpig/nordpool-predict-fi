Exchange electricity price expectations will vary during the coming week. The most expensive day is expected to be **Monday**, when the average price will rise to 8.9 cents per kilowatt-hour. The maximum price for Monday is forecast at 16.0 ¢, but the prices for individual hours may rise even higher.

Monday's higher price is partly explained by the low amount of wind power in the morning. Wind power production will drop to a low of only 512 megawatts. Due to the weak wind situation, the price of electricity may rise to a high level, especially in the morning between 8 and 10 o'clock. At night, however, electricity will be very cheap, even below zero.

On other days, the price will vary less. **Tuesday** will be the cheapest day of the week, with an average price of 5.9 cents. On Tuesday, the price of electricity will remain below nine cents per kilowatt-hour throughout the day.

The average prices for Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday will be around 6-8 cents. On these days, the price differences within the day will remain moderate.

Next **Sunday**, the average price of electricity will rise again to over seven cents. Freezing temperatures are expected on Sunday, with the average daily temperature dropping to -8.8 degrees Celsius. The maximum price on Sunday will rise to 11.3 cents per kilowatt-hour.
