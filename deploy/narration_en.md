In the coming days, electricity prices will vary significantly, with the week including both affordable and expensive periods. Especially on **Wednesday**, high prices are expected, pushing the average price to 9,7 cents. The hourly peak on Wednesday will occur in the morning between 7:00 and 9:00, when the price could rise above 16 cents. The risk of price spikes on Wednesday is considerable, potentially reaching 20-40 cents per individual hour.

Prices will also remain relatively high on **Thursday**, with an average daily price of 8,7 cents and peak prices around 15 cents in the morning between 9:00 and 11:00. A high risk of price spikes also applies to Thursday, during which hourly prices could again reach 20-40 cents.

The week's cheapest day will be **Sunday**, when the average price will drop below two cents. Negative prices will also occur early Sunday morning and during the afternoon, briefly dropping electricity prices as low as -0,7 cents.

The price level on **Tuesday** will be moderately high, with an average of around 7,8 cents. The day's peak price, 12,6 cents, will occur around 21:00. Tuesday also carries a risk of price spikes, potentially pushing single-hour prices up to 20 cents.
