During the coming week, electricity price forecasts indicate steady variation, but individual hourly spikes may stand out, especially at the beginning of the week. **On Monday**, the average price is expected to rise to about 3.4 cents, with intra-day prices ranging from zero to seven cents. Prices may briefly climb during morning and evening hours, and according to the forecast, there is potential for spikes up to ten cents per kilowatt-hour during specific hours, particularly between 8–10 a.m. and 7–9 p.m. Wind power is projected to be significantly lower than average on Monday, which, together with other factors, explains the higher price expectations.

**On Tuesday**, the average price is forecast to decrease to 2.6 cents, but again, individual hours could see prices rise higher than anticipated, possibly up to ten cents. The lowest wind power output occurs during the night and early morning, driving higher peak prices between 8–10 a.m. **On Wednesday**, prices are expected to remain moderate, with an average of 2.4 cents, yet the risk of individual hourly price spikes persists, especially during morning and evening periods.

From midweek onwards, **Thursday** and **Friday** show a continued similar pattern, with average prices remaining around 2.5–2.8 cents. On these days as well, there is a possibility of isolated higher hourly prices, even if the overall price level remains moderate. **On Thursday**, minimum wind power output drops temporarily below 1,500 megawatts, which, together with other factors, pushes the day's maximum price higher during the 8–10 a.m. window.

The lowest prices of the week are expected on the weekend. **Sunday** and **Saturday** are projected to be clearly more affordable than other days, with average prices staying below one cent. Especially on Sunday, electricity prices will hover near zero and occasionally dip into negative territory during night and morning hours. On Saturday, prices remain consistently low throughout the day, with no significant price spikes anticipated.

Overall, the most affordable moments will occur during both weekend days, while early in the week — on Monday and Tuesday — consumers should be prepared for the possibility of higher hourly prices, especially in the morning and evening. Price fluctuations follow the variations in wind power generation, and the lowest wind output often coincides with the highest prices. No exceptionally low or high temperatures are expected during the week, so price levels are shaped mainly by momentary changes in electricity production and consumption.
