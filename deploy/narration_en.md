Electricity price expectations for the coming week will vary considerably between days. On **Thursday** and **Friday**, prices will rise to their highest levels, and there is a significant risk of price spikes of up to 20‚Äì30 cents per kWh on individual hours. The average electricity price on these days will range between 7.7 and 8.5 ¬¢. On Thursday, the highest expected price, 13.4 cents, will occur between 17:00‚Äì19:00. On Friday, the highest forecasted price of 16.5 ¬¢ is expected in the morning hours between 07:00‚Äì09:00. Particularly low wind power production in the mornings and evenings on these days explains possible price increases.

The forecast for the weekend promises significantly cheaper electricity prices. On **Saturday**, the average electricity price will drop to a very low level of only 0.7 cents, and prices will even become negative during night and early morning hours. Saturday's lowest price, -1.7 ¬¢, will occur between midnight and 02:00. On **Sunday**, electricity prices will remain negative nearly throughout the entire day, averaging -0.6 cents. Sunday's lowest price of -1.9 ¬¢ will be observed in the afternoon between 13:00‚Äì15:00.

Early in the week, on **Monday** and **Tuesday**, prices will continue to remain low. Monday's average price will be 1.9 cents, and Tuesday's 1.4 cents. Both days will also experience negative hourly prices. On Tuesday, the lowest price (-1.0 ¬¢) will occur in the afternoon between 13:00‚Äì15:00.

On **Wednesday**, prices will rise slightly from early-week levels but will still remain moderate. Wednesday's average forecast price is 3.1 cents, and the day's highest price, 7.8 cents, will occur during the evening hours between 18:00‚Äì20:00. Negative prices will also be available during Wednesday night and early morning hours, reaching a minimum of -1.0 cents between 01:00‚Äì03:00.

Price fluctuations this week will be notably larger, especially when comparing weekend and late-week days. Consumers will likely find the most attractive times during the weekend and early in the week, when electricity usage will be exceptionally affordable and occasionally even free of charge.
