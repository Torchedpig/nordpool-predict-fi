*In the upcoming week, electricity prices will range from negative values to possible high price spikes on Tuesday, and the maintenance outage at Olkiluoto 3 may affect forecast accuracy.*

Electricity prices will vary significantly from day to day during the coming week. The week's lowest-priced day will be **Sunday**, when the average electricity price will even turn negative, around -0.1 cents. Sunday's cheapest hours will occur in the afternoon between 15:00 and 17:00, when prices could drop as low as -2.2 cents. Negative pricing will also be seen during the early morning hours of **Monday** and **Wednesday**, reaching lows around -1.2 and -1.4 cents respectively.

The highest prices of the week will occur on **Tuesday**, with an average electricity price around 4.7 cents. However, individual hourly prices on Tuesday could rise significantly higher than the current forecast of 14.2 cents. The risk of price spikes will be particularly high in the evening between 19:00 and 21:00. This is notably influenced by Tuesday's very low minimum wind power production of approximately 561 MW, explaining the elevated price level forecasted.

On **Thursday** as well, the average electricity price will climb to around five cents. During Thursday morning between 07:00 and 09:00, individual hourly prices could approach ten cents, with risks of further price spikes reaching up to 10 cents. On Saturday, the average price will remain moderate at 2.6 cents, but hourly prices could momentarily rise close to ten cents, especially in the evening hours between 19:00 and 21:00.

On Friday, which is a public holiday, electricity demand could be lower than usual, potentially lowering price expectations. The day's average price will thus remain just above two cents, with maximum prices staying under five cents.

Throughout the week, wind power production will vary considerably. On Monday, wind power will be abundant, averaging over 5200 MW, supporting the lower price level. Tuesday's low wind power availability will clearly translate into higher prices. On other days, wind power generation will be closer to normal levels, having no significant impact on electricity pricing.
