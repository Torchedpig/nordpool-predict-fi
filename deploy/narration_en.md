Electricity prices will vary notably in the coming days. Thursday stands out clearly with the highest expected prices. The day's average will be around five cents per kilowatt-hour, with hourly rates potentially reaching as high as 11.1 cents. Additionally, there's a significant risk of price spikes on Thursday, with individual hourly prices possibly rising to between 10 and 20 cents. Thursday will also be a public holiday, which would lower energy demand compared to a regular weekday. Wind power production on Thursday will mostly be normal, though low wind conditions early in the morning around midnight to 2 AM partly explain higher prices.

On Friday, the first day of the weekend, the electricity price will be significantly lower. The day's average will remain below one cent, and overnight prices will dip negative (-0.7 ¢), meaning very affordable electricity. Friday's abundant wind power, averaging over 5000 MW, explains this low price level.

Both **Saturday** and **Sunday** will also offer low-priced electricity to consumers, with average prices consistently below one cent. Saturday's lowest price (-0.6 ¢) occurs in the afternoon at 3 PM. On Sunday, the lowest price (-0.9 ¢) is forecasted overnight at 2 AM. Both days will have ample wind production, helping keep prices low.

Early next week, prices will rise slightly again. **Monday** and **Tuesday** will still remain affordable, averaging around three cents. On Tuesday evening between 9–11 PM, the price will peak at around 7.2 cents, but without significant risk of price spikes.

Next **Wednesday**, the average price will climb slightly higher again, to around four and a half cents. Prices on Wednesday will be steadier during the day, but in the evening between 8–10 PM, it will reach its highest levels, around seven cents. There is also a noted risk of price spikes on Wednesday, where hourly prices could rise up to around 10 cents.
