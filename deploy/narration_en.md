During the current week, electricity prices will vary significantly. **Wednesday** appears to be the cheapest day of the week, with an average price of 3.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. This is influenced by strong wind power production, which lowers prices, especially at night and in the morning. The most expensive days of the week are **Tuesday** and **Sunday**, with average prices of 8.7 and 7.7 cents, respectively. There is also a risk of price spikes on Sunday and Tuesday, when prices can rise to as much as 20 cents during individual hours.

On **Thursday** and **Friday**, prices are quite similar, with average prices just over seven cents. Wind power production is more moderate on these days than on Wednesday, which contributes to the rise in prices. **Saturday** offers slightly cheaper electricity, especially in the early morning and morning, when prices remain low. Saturday's average price is 5.3 cents, making it the second cheapest day of the week.

At the beginning of next week, **Monday**, the price level remains high, similar to Sunday. Wind power production is relatively low, which, combined with higher maximum prices, raises the average price. This trend continues on **Tuesday**, when the highest average price of the week is expected. On Tuesday, wind power production is forecast to be at its lowest level of the week, partly explaining the rise in prices. In light of these factors, electricity price expectations are quite variable in the coming days.
