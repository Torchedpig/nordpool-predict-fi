Olkiluoto 1 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The outage started on 11 May 2025 at 18:00, and its estimated end time is 22 May 2025 at 18:00. This maintenance break may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data during maintenance periods is limited.

Electricity prices over the next few days will exhibit considerable variation. The most expensive day of the week will be **Friday**, with an average price of 3.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. Friday's prices include a substantial range of variation: between 8:00 and 9:00 in the morning, the price will approach 19 cents, while in the afternoon electricity will be available for less than one cent.

Over the weekend, prices will drop significantly. On **Saturday**, electricity will cost on average just 0.3 ¬¢, and prices during nighttime and afternoon hours will even dip slightly negative (-0.7 ¬¢). Also on **Sunday**, the electricity market average price will turn negative (-0.3 ¬¢). Sunday's lowest hourly price will be -1.6 cents, and the highest will remain below two cents.

At the beginning of next week, prices will remain moderate. **Monday's** average price will be 1.4 ¬¢, with a moderate variation range from 0.3 to 3.4 cents. On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, prices will also stay low, with average prices around one cent.

Next week's **Thursday** will continue with a moderate price level. The day's average price will rise to 1.6 ¬¢, and no significant price spikes are expected. Thursday's highest price will remain at 3.4 cents, while the nighttime price will briefly dip slightly negative (-0.1 ¬¢).

The week's price fluctuations are partly explained by wind power variability. Strong wind power production supports particularly low average prices on Saturday and Sunday, reaching peaks above 4,500 megawatts during the weekend. Friday's morning price peak, on the other hand, will be explained by momentary low wind power production: at 9:00 in the morning, production will drop to approximately 500 megawatts.
