*The upcoming week will mostly bring affordable electricity prices, but on Tuesday, rates may momentarily spike above 20 cents per kilowatt-hour; however, the ongoing maintenance outage at the Olkiluoto 3 nuclear plant may affect forecast accuracy.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is undergoing a maintenance outage. The outage is scheduled from 1 March 2025 at 03:00 to 2 May 2025 at 02:00. Due to limited historical data available for such situations, this outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast.

Forecast updated on Saturday at 14:18.

The electricity price forecast for the coming week shows noticeable differences between days. Early in the week, average prices will remain affordable, but prices will rise notably on **Tuesday**, with an expected daily average reaching six cents per kilowatt-hour. On the same day, peak electricity prices may briefly exceed 20‚Äì30 cents per kWh, especially during morning hours between 8:00‚Äì10:00. The primary cause for this spike is exceptionally low wind power production, dropping below 500 megawatts at its lowest.

On other days, electricity prices will remain moderate. On **Sunday** and **Monday**, there will even be negative hourly prices during nighttime and early afternoon, making electricity almost free or even resulting in producers receiving negative payments.

Price expectations on **Wednesday** and **Thursday** will closely resemble each other, with average prices between 1.4‚Äì1.6 cents. Toward the end of the week, electricity prices will decrease further. Due to Friday being a public holiday, electricity demand is expected to be lower than usual, resulting in some of the week's lowest prices, averaging 0.8 cents per kilowatt-hour.

**Saturday** will have an even lower expected average price of 0.4 cents, including the week's lowest hourly prices at -2.1 cents per kilowatt-hour. The abundant wind power generation on Saturday will contribute significantly to this low price level.

Overall, the week's pricing outlook will be predominantly affordable, but Tuesday stands out clearly due to a significant price spike. On Tuesday, hourly prices may rise considerably above the predicted maximum, so electricity consumers should prepare for potentially substantial price increases during certain times of the day.
