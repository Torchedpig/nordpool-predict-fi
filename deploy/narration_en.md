|    | average<br>price<br>¬¢/kWh | min - max<br>¬¢/kWh | wind power<br>min - max<br>MW | average<br>temperature<br>¬∞C |
|:-------------|:----------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  **Thursday**  |  4.2 | 0.6 - 13.0  | 1771 - 3281  |  -0.9 |
| **Friday** |  8.6 | 3.8 - 15.4  | 1048 - 2957  |  -0.9 |
|  **Saturday** |  8.8 | 2.3 - 14.3  | 957 - 3211   |  -1.1 |
| **Sunday** |  4.6 | 0.6 - 9.3  | 3479 - 5358  |  -1.4 |
|  **Monday**|  3.0 | -0.2 - 6.8 | 4919 - 5568  |   0.7 |
|   **Tuesday** |  1.7 | -0.4 - 3.6 | 5323 - 5854  |   0.6 |
|**Wednesday**|  3.3 | 0.1 - 6.9  | 3662 - 5500  |   0.6 |

Next week, exchange electricity price expectations will vary significantly. The cheapest days will be the first days of the week, when the average price of electricity will remain below four cents per kilowatt-hour. The most expensive days will be **Friday** and **Saturday** at the end of the week, when average prices will rise above eight cents.

A high risk of price spikes is forecast for Friday and Saturday. The prices of individual hours can rise up to 20-40 cents per kilowatt-hour, which clearly exceeds the maximum price forecasts presented in the table. The risk of price spikes is particularly associated with the morning and early evening hours. For example, on Friday, the highest price, 15.4 ¬¢, is forecast for 7 PM in the hourly forecast, but the actual price peak may occur between 6 PM and 8 PM. On Saturday, the hourly maximum price is 14.3 ¬¢ at 7 PM, but if it materializes, the peak may occur between 6 PM and 8 PM.

The price spikes are caused by the low level of wind power. On Friday, wind power production will be at its lowest at 1048 megawatts and on Saturday at 957 megawatts. The combination of low wind power production and high consumption can significantly increase the price of electricity during individual hours.

Next **Sunday** and **Monday**, the price of electricity will fall again as wind power production increases significantly. On Sunday, wind power will be available at an average of 4186 megawatts and on Monday as much as 5310 megawatts. As a result, the average price for Sunday is forecast to be 4.6 ¬¢ and for Monday only 3.0 ¬¢. On Monday, it is even possible that the price of electricity will temporarily fall into negative territory: the lowest price (-0.2 ¬¢) will occur during the early morning hours between 1 AM and 2 AM.

Next **Tuesday**, wind power production will continue to be abundant, averaging 5592 megawatts. The price will remain low, and the average price for Tuesday is expected to be only 1.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. Tuesday's lowest price (-0.4 ¬¢) will occur during the night between 1 AM and 2 AM. Also next **Wednesday**, electricity will be cheap, with an average price of 3.3 ¬¢.
