The coming week looks twofold in terms of the price of electricity on the Nord Pool exchange. The beginning of the week is expensive, but towards the end of the week, the price of electricity will fall significantly.

On **Monday**, the average price of electricity will rise very high, to 16.0 cents per kilowatt-hour. Monday's highest price, 27.5 ¢, will be during the morning hours of 8-10 AM. The lowest price of the day, 7.8 ¢, is expected late in the evening. Monday's price is raised by low wind power production, which will remain at its lowest at only 212 megawatts during the day. The severe frost, -8.0 degrees, will also increase the price of electricity.

On **Tuesday**, the average price of electricity will settle at 11.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. The price will be at its highest, 16.6 ¢, in the morning between 9-11 AM. However, on Tuesday there is a high risk of price spikes, up to 30-50 cents in individual hours. Also on Tuesday, the frost will continue to be severe, at -8.3 degrees.

On **Wednesday**, the average price will remain almost at Tuesday's levels, at 11.6 cents. Wednesday's highest price, 15.5 ¢, will be during the late morning hours of 11 AM - 1 PM. A high risk of price spikes is also forecast for Wednesday, up to 30-50 cents in individual hours. Wednesday's average temperature is -9.3 degrees.

On **Thursday**, the average price of electricity will be 10.7 ¢. The day's highest price will be 16.2 ¢ in the morning between 7-9 AM. On Thursday, too, there is a high risk of price spikes, up to 30-40 cents in individual hours. Like Wednesday, Thursday's average temperature is -9.3 degrees.

From Friday onwards, the price of electricity will turn to a clear decline. On **Friday**, the average price will be only 3.1 ¢, and the intra-day variation will be small, only 1.3 - 5.2 ¢. Friday's lowest price will be during the early morning hours. On **Saturday** and Sunday, prices will already be very affordable, with Saturday's average price being 1.1 ¢ and Sunday's 1.4 ¢. On Saturday, electricity will even be free for a moment, when the price drops to -0.2 cents at night between 12-2 AM. The affordable prices at the end of the week are largely explained by abundant wind power, which will be available up to over 5000 megawatts during the weekend.
