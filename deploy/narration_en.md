The coming week looks volatile in terms of electricity prices. During the weekend, prices will remain at a reasonable level, but next **Monday** a clear jump upwards is expected. The average price on Monday will rise to 12.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, and the highest price of the day could rise to 21.1 cents. A significant risk of price spikes is also forecast for Monday, with prices for individual hours potentially rising as high as 30-50 cents. The most likely time for a price spike is in the afternoon and early evening, around 5-7 PM.

The rise in prices on Monday is partly explained by strong fluctuations in wind power production. Although wind power will be available at its best up to 3539 MW during the day, production will fall to only 749 MW in the evening. The freezing cold, with an average temperature of -8.0 degrees, also contributes to the higher price level.

On **Tuesday**, the price of electricity will fall slightly, settling at an average of 9.1 cents per kilowatt-hour. Between Tuesday and Wednesday night, the price of electricity is expected to fall to its lowest, 4.3 cents per kilowatt-hour.

On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, average electricity prices will remain around 9-10 cents. On Wednesday and Thursday, there is also a risk of individual price spikes, with prices temporarily rising to as high as 20 cents per kilowatt-hour. The most likely time for a price spike on Wednesday is in the early evening, around 6-8 PM. For Thursday, a similar spike is expected in the morning, around 7-9 AM.

Next **Friday**, the price of electricity will turn to a clear decline. The average price for Friday is expected to be only 2.7 cents per kilowatt-hour, and at its cheapest, electricity will be available for only 1.1 cents. Friday's low price is explained by the abundant supply of wind power, as wind turbines are forecast to produce an average of 4310 MW of electricity. Between Friday and Saturday night, the price of electricity will drop very low, even below 2 cents.
