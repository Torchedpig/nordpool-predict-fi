The electricity price level over the weekend will remain exceptionally low. On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, average prices will be very low, and during some hours the price of electricity may even dip slightly negative, especially in the early hours of Sunday morning. Wind power production will be at a high level over the weekend, which explains the low price expectations.

At the beginning of the week, electricity prices will start to rise, but will still remain at a reasonable level. On **Monday**, the average price will rise to just over two cents, and the highest hourly price of the day will occur between late morning and early afternoon, reaching up to 4.6 cents per kilowatt hour. **Tuesday** will see a very similar price trend, with the maximum price remaining slightly lower.

On **Wednesday**, prices will decrease again, and the day's average price will be clearly lower than earlier in the week. Wind power production will fluctuate widely during this day, but price variations will remain moderate.

On **Thursday** and **Friday**, electricity prices will rise again. On Thursday, the intraday maximum price will reach 5.3 cents, and on Friday, the highest prices of the week are expected: the top hourly price of the day will rise to 6.2 cents. In addition, Thursday and Friday are forecasted to have an increased risk for hourly price spikes—at certain hours, prices may temporarily climb as high as 10 cents. These spikes may occur especially during morning and evening hours, when electricity consumption is at its peak. At the end of the week, wind power production will fall significantly compared to earlier in the week, which supports higher price expectations especially on Friday.

Looking at the whole week, the most affordable periods will be during the weekend, while the clearly highest price level is expected on Friday. Prices will vary considerably throughout the week, but will remain well below typical high-price levels overall.
