*Electricity prices in the coming days will show clear variations: sharp price spikes are expected on Thursday and Friday mornings and afternoons due to weak wind power generation, while prices over the weekend will drop to moderate and even very affordable levels thanks to strong winds.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The maintenance outage began on 1 March 2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on 28 April 2025 at 01:00. This may affect the accuracy of price forecasts, as limited training data is available from similar situations.

Price expectations for the upcoming days will vary considerably. **Thursday** will clearly be the week's most expensive day, with an average electricity price rising to 15.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Thursday morning, around 7‚Äì9 am, the electricity price will increase sharply, and the forecast indicates a peak price exceeding 30 cents at around 8 am. Additionally, Thursday carries a significant risk of price spikes, possibly pushing hourly prices even to 40‚Äì60 cents.

**Friday** will also see significant variation in electricity prices. During the morning hours, prices will climb above 25 cents, and there remains a risk of price spikes. Individual hourly prices on Friday could reach as high as 30‚Äì50 cents. Both Thursday's and Friday's high price peaks are linked to low wind power production during the morning hours, with minimum wind power output dropping clearly below 1,000 megawatts.

The weekend, particularly **Saturday**, will offer significantly lower electricity prices. Saturday's average price will settle just above four cents, and at its lowest, electricity will be nearly free around 4 am (0.3 ¬¢). Wind energy production on Saturday will rise clearly above normal levels, partly explaining the low price level.

On **Sunday**, price levels will rise slightly from Saturday but will remain moderate. Sunday's average price will be five cents, peaking around 12 cents at approximately 9 am. Sunday also carries a slight risk of prices rising above the forecast, potentially up to around 10 cents in individual hours.

Early next week, prices will rise moderately from the weekend levels. Average prices on **Monday** and **Tuesday** will hover around seven cents, but both days carry a risk of hourly prices reaching up to 20 cents. On **Wednesday**, prices will moderate slightly again, with an average price below six cents and the day's highest price under ten cents.
