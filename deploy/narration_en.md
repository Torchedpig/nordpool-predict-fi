During the upcoming week, electricity prices on the exchange will vary notably from day to day. Overall, average prices for the week will remain at affordable levels, but **Wednesday** will clearly stand out with a higher average price. Wednesday's average price will rise to five cents, and the maximum price will also reach the week's highest level at 10.7 cents per kilowatt hour. The peak price risk model forecasts a possibility for individual peak prices exceeding 10 cents on Wednesday. Wednesday's highest prices will occur in the morning between 07:00 and 09:00, when prices may exceed ten cents.

On Tuesday and next Monday, expected price levels will remain moderate, even though maximum prices will slightly exceed six cents and nearly reach eight cents. Tuesday's most expensive hours will occur in the evening between 20:00 and 22:00. Next Monday, peak prices will similarly occur in the evening between 18:00 and 20:00, when prices approach eight cents.

Thursday, a public holiday, will see extremely low prices, even turning negative during certain nighttime and afternoon hours. On Thursday, the lowest prices, around -1.3 cents, will occur between 14:00 and 16:00. The reduced electricity demand due to the public holiday will contribute to keeping prices low throughout the day.

On Friday and during the weekend, prices are also expected to remain exceptionally low. Friday's daily average price will stand at 0.5 cents, and prices will briefly turn negative in the afternoon between 15:00 and 17:00. Saturday and Sunday will continue this affordable trend, with short periods of negative prices on both days. Sunday's lowest price, reaching as low as -1.5 cents, will occur at night between 01:00 and 03:00.

In summary, electricity price developments in the upcoming week will be highly varied. Wednesday will clearly be the most expensive day, while Thursday and Friday offer exceptionally inexpensive hours. For price-conscious electricity consumers, these daily fluctuations provide opportunities to direct usage to more affordable periods.
