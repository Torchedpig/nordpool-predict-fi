The electricity price expectations for the coming week vary considerably. During the weekend, the price will rise from Saturday, but will still remain below ten cents per kilowatt-hour. However, price spikes are expected during the weekend. On Sunday, the prices for individual hours can rise up to 20-30 cents, and on Monday even up to 30-40 cents per kilowatt-hour.

On **Monday**, the average price of electricity on the power exchange will rise significantly, making it the most expensive day of the week, with an average price of 11.4 ¢/kWh. Monday's high price is explained by the low wind power, which is predicted to remain below 2000 megawatts on average during the day. Monday's price peak is likely to occur in the morning hours, between approximately 7-9 am.

On **Tuesday**, the price of electricity will settle slightly lower than on Monday, with an average price of 9.7 ¢/kWh. Individual price spikes are also expected on Tuesday, which can raise hourly prices up to 20 cents. The most likely time for a price peak is on Tuesday morning, around 8-10 am.

In the middle of next week, on **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, the price of electricity will fall again to a more affordable level, below five cents per kilowatt-hour. The difference between Wednesday and Thursday will remain small. On Wednesday, there will be plenty of wind power available, on average 4685 megawatts, which partly explains the lower price level.

On **Friday**, the price will rise again, but will still remain below an average price of ten cents. Friday's predicted maximum price of 14.6 ¢/kWh may indicate a higher price level for individual hours.
