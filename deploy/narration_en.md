Olkiluoto 1 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. This outage started on 11 May 2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 22 May 2025 at 18:00. This maintenance break may affect the accuracy of the price forecast due to limited available training data during outage periods.

Electricity prices in the coming days will remain affordable on average. However, there will be some variation between days, both in average prices and individual hourly rates.

The week's highest daily average price will occur on **Friday**, rising to 1.9 cents per kilowatt-hour. On the same day, there will be a significant risk of short-term price spikes. Particularly during the morning rush between 7–9 am, hourly prices may climb above ten cents per kilowatt-hour. Friday’s highest hourly rate, forecasted at 10.2 ¢, will occur during this morning peak. This price increase can largely be explained by very low wind power production, which falls below 700 megawatts at its minimum on Friday.

Additionally, there is a notable risk for isolated price peaks on **Saturday** and **Tuesday**. Saturday's variations are more moderate than Friday’s, but individual hourly prices may still reach 2.4 cents. On Tuesday, fluctuations are somewhat larger, and prices might rise up to five cents per kilowatt-hour between 8–10 am. On both days, the minimum wind power production remains under 2000 megawatts, partly explaining these higher peak prices.

The cheapest days of the week will be **Thursday** and **Sunday**, when average prices will stay negative. On Thursday, the lowest hourly rate will dip as low as -2.7 cents between 5–6 am. Similarly, Sunday morning between 11 am–1 pm, prices will reach their lowest point at -2.2 cents. On both days, abundant wind power availability will contribute to lowering prices.

Monday and Wednesday will exhibit fairly stable and moderate prices, with daily averages staying below one cent. No risk for price spikes has been indicated for these days, and stable hourly prices are expected throughout these periods.
