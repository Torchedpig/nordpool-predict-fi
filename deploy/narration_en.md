The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The outage began on 1 March 2025 at 03:00 and is estimated to end on 2 May 2025 at 02:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of forecasts, as training data during outages is limited.

Electricity prices will vary considerably in the coming days. Price fluctuations will be substantial, primarily influenced by large variations in wind power production.

The cheapest days of the week will be **Friday** and **Wednesday**. On Friday, the average electricity price will remain negative at approximately -0.1 cents, and on Wednesday only slightly above that, at about 0.2 cents. On Friday, prices will stay extremely low throughout the day, reaching their lowest point of -1.0 cents in the early morning hours between 4:00 and 6:00. On Wednesday, strong wind production will explain the low electricity prices, keeping prices very affordable throughout the day.

**Monday** will clearly be the most expensive day of the week. The expected average electricity price will be around 7.0 cents, with the maximum price rising to 12.8 cents in the morning between 7:00 and 9:00. Additionally, there is a risk on Monday that prices might spike up to 20 cents during individual hours.

Prices will also rise significantly on **Thursday**. The day's forecasted average price will be slightly above five cents, with peak prices potentially reaching 15.1 cents between 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning. Furthermore, there is a considerable risk of price spikes on Thursday, when hourly prices could rise as high as 20 cents. This is partly due to exceptionally low minimum wind power production that day, at only 1242 megawatts.

Prices on **Sunday** will remain moderate, but individual price spikes may also occur. The day's expected average price is approximately four cents, but hourly prices might rise up to 10 cents, most likely between 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning.

On other days of the week, electricity prices will remain reasonable without significant risks of price spikes.
