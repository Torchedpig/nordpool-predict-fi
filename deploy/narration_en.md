The start of the week will look very affordable. Especially on **Saturday** and **Sunday**, the average electricity price is expected to remain low, below one cent. Sunday is forecast to be the cheapest day of the week, with the lowest hourly price dipping into negative territory at -0.6 cents. Even the highest hourly prices that day are well below two cents.

**Monday** will see a rise in the average price, with hourly prices exceeding five cents during the morning. On Tuesday, prices will decrease somewhat, but individual hours may reach three to four cents. On Wednesday, prices are expected to remain moderate, and minimum prices may briefly drop just below zero at night.

**Thursday** and **Friday** will deviate clearly from the earlier part of the week. On Thursday, the risk of price spikes will be elevated, and electricity can cost up to ten cents per kilowatt-hour during individual hours, even though the daily average remains around two cents. On Friday, the average price will rise to the highest level of the week at 4.2 cents, and within the day, the highest hourly price could reach as much as ten cents if spikes materialize. Especially on Friday, wind power is expected to be at a low level, which, together with the risk of price spikes, explains the higher price forecast.

Overall, the average price for the week will remain clearly below ten cents, and no day will reach the threshold for expensive electricity in terms of average price. Negative hourly prices will occur during the week at night, especially in the early hours of Sunday and Tuesday. Wind power production is mostly at a typical level, but on Thursday and Friday its minimum value drops below 1,500 megawatts, which is exceptionally low and increases the risk of high individual prices.

The most affordable electricity periods of the week will fall on the weekend, while the most expensive hours will be seen next Friday, especially in the late evening. Price variations will increase towards the end of the week, but overall the week appears favorable for electricity users according to the forecasts.
