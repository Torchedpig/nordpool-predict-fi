The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The outage started on 1 March 2025 at 03:00 and is estimated to end on 2 May 2025 at 02:00. The outage may affect the accuracy of forecasts, as training data from maintenance periods is limited.

The electricity price forecast for the coming days shows a clear upward trend as the week progresses. During the weekend, electricity prices will remain very affordable. On **Saturday**, the average price will even hover slightly below zero, at -0.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. Throughout the day, prices will fluctuate between -1.1 and 1.4 cents. On **Sunday** as well, prices will remain low, with an average price of just 0.1 cents. Both days will see certain hours with negative prices.

At the beginning of the week, on **Monday**, prices will rise modestly, but the average will still remain affordable at 2.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. Monday's highest prices will occur in the evening hours between 17:00 and 19:00, when the price momentarily exceeds six cents.

On **Tuesday**, prices will continue to rise, although the daily average will still stay relatively low at 3.7 cents. The priciest hours on Tuesday will occur in the morning between 8:00 and 10:00, with prices rising above seven cents.

Starting from mid-week, electricity prices will show a marked increase. On **Wednesday**, the average price will climb to 6.8 cents, and peak prices will surpass 11 cents in the evening hours between 18:00 and 20:00.

On **Thursday** and **Friday**, prices will rise to clearly higher levels.
