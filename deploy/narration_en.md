Exchange electricity price expectations will vary during the coming week. The most expensive day of the week will be **Saturday**, when the average price of exchange electricity will be 7.6 ¢/kWh and the highest price of the day will rise to 12.9 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Saturday, there is also a risk that the prices for individual hours could rise to as much as 20-30 cents. The price peak is most likely to occur in the early evening, between 4 and 6 PM.

After Saturday, the price of exchange electricity will turn downwards. On **Sunday**, the average price will be only 3.4 ¢/kWh, and the lowest price will be only 0.6 ¢/kWh. Sunday's wind power production will remain high, at an average of 4622 MW, which partly explains the affordable price level.

Next week, the price of exchange electricity will continue to fall. From Monday to Thursday, average prices will remain below three cents per kilowatt-hour. Particularly affordable electricity is expected on **Tuesday**, when the average price will be only 1.6 ¢/kWh and the price will fall to as low as -0.7 cents at its lowest. On **Thursday**, the price will also momentarily go into negative territory.

Throughout the week, wind power will be mostly readily available, which will keep prices low. Only on Saturday will wind power production be significantly lower, at an average of 2210 MW, and on that day production will momentarily fall below 600 MW during the day. The higher price on Saturday is partly explained by the low wind power.

Next **Friday**, the average price of exchange electricity will rise to 3.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. Wind power production on Friday will be at a significantly lower level than on other days (average 3658 MW), but still at such a high level that it will not have a significant impact on the price.
