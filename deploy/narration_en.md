On Tuesday, electricity price fluctuations will be the highest of the week. The day's average price will be 10.3 cents per kilowatt-hour, with the highest hourly prices expected between 9–11 am, reaching approximately 18.6 cents. Additionally, Tuesday's forecast includes a significant risk of individual price spikes, possibly rising up to 30–40 cents during morning hours. This is partly due to very low wind power generation, occasionally dropping below 700 megawatts.

From Wednesday onwards, electricity prices will clearly stabilize. On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, the average price will decrease significantly to 4.1 and 3.1 cents per kilowatt-hour, respectively. However, there will be notable hourly variations on Thursday; prices may momentarily exceed 10 cents during the morning hours around 8–10 am, but will drop dramatically in the evening and nighttime, even as low as approximately 0.2 cents per kilowatt-hour.

The week's most affordable days will occur on **Friday** and **Saturday**, when average prices will be exceptionally low. On Friday, the average price will remain below one cent, and on Saturday, it will even fall negative to -0.9 cents. This means that during certain hours, electricity prices may be as low as -2.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. Negative prices will especially occur during morning and afternoon hours when wind power production is abundant, nearing up to 6000 megawatts.

Price levels on Sunday and next **Monday** will be somewhat higher, yet still moderate. Sunday's average price will be 4.6 cents, with potential single-hour spikes reaching around 10 cents. Next Monday, the average price will rise slightly to approximately 6.5 cents, with the day's highest hourly price possibly climbing up to 13.6 cents in the afternoon. There is also a risk that individual hours on Monday may see prices spike even higher, possibly up to 20 cents.

Overall, the week's price development will be clearly divided, with more expensive days in the beginning and very affordable prices toward the weekend. Tuesday's high prices and negative prices toward the week's end will make the coming week notably variable in terms of pricing.
