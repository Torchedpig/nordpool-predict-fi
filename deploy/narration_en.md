Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is undergoing a maintenance shutdown. The outage began on March 1, 2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on May 2, 2025 at 02:00. The maintenance may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data during outages is limited.

The forecast was updated on Friday at 14:18.

Electricity prices for the upcoming week will vary significantly from day to day. According to current forecasts, the most expensive days will be **Monday** and **Sunday**. Monday's expected average price is 11.9 ¢, and prices may rise above 20 cents in the morning between 9:00 and 11:00. Additionally, Monday carries a high risk of price spikes, with individual hourly prices potentially reaching levels of 30–50 ¢.

On Sunday, prices will also rise notably towards the evening. The day's average is expected to be around 7.2 ¢, but between 19:00 and 21:00, prices may exceed 15 cents. The risk of price spikes on Sunday is high, and hourly prices could potentially rise to levels of 20–30 ¢. Sunday's unusually high maximum price is partly explained by very low minimum wind power production (just 286 MW).

The cheapest days of the week will be **Saturday**, **Thursday**, and **Friday**, when prices will mostly be low and at times even negative. On the first Saturday, electricity prices will mostly hover around zero, averaging just 0.2 ¢, and briefly dipping slightly below zero at night. Thursday and Friday will also have very low average prices, around one cent, with Thursday seeing the week's lowest price level in the afternoon between 14:00 and 16:00, dropping to -1.5 cents.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, price expectations will remain moderate, between 2 and 4 cents. Price variations on these days will be relatively minor with no price spikes expected. Next Saturday is also expected to have stable electricity prices around three cents, without significant variations.

The nuclear plant maintenance outage may introduce uncertainty to the accuracy of this forecast. Actual prices may therefore deviate from the forecast, particularly on Sunday and Monday, the days with higher risk.
