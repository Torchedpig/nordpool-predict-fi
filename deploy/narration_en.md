The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage. The outage began on 1 March 2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on 2 May 2025 at 02:00. The maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as limited training data is available for outage periods.

During the coming week, electricity prices will vary notably between days. On most days, however, prices will remain relatively affordable. Clearly, the most expensive day will be **Tuesday**, when the average price is expected to reach 8.2 cents. Tuesday's highest hourly price will peak at 14.5 cents between 7 am and 9 am. Additionally, there is a high risk of price spikes on this day, potentially pushing hourly prices as high as 20–30 cents.

Over the weekend, prices will fluctuate considerably. On **Saturday**, the average price will be 5.2 cents, but intraday variation will be significant: the lowest price will occur at night, at just 0.6 cents, while the highest price will reach 10.5 cents between 9 am and 11 am. Saturday also carries a risk of price spikes, potentially raising hourly rates up to 20 cents.

**Sunday** will be the cheapest day of the week, with an average price of just 0.9 cents. Negative prices will also occur during early morning and afternoon hours, dropping as low as -1.0 cents. This is partly because Sunday is a public holiday, when energy demand is typically lower.

At the start of the week, on **Monday**, price levels will remain moderate, with an average price of 3.4 cents. However, a risk of price spikes is forecasted for this day as well, potentially raising hourly rates up to 10 cents. Midweek, **Wednesday** prices will return close to the weekly average, standing at 5.6 cents. Wednesday also carries a risk of price spikes around 20 cents.

Toward the end of the week, on **Thursday** and **Friday**, prices will again be lower. Thursday's average price will be only 0.9 cents and Friday's average price will remain at 3.5 cents. Both days will see brief periods of negative electricity prices.
