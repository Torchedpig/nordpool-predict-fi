*Electricity prices for the coming days are mostly affordable, but high price spikes are forecasted for Thursday and Tuesday mornings due to low wind power production; the maintenance outage at Olkiluoto 3 may affect forecast accuracy.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage. The outage began on 1 March 2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on 2 May 2025 at 02:00. Due to this maintenance outage, the accuracy of the price forecast may be reduced, as training data during outages is limited.

Forecast updated on Tuesday at 09:00.

The electricity price outlook for the coming days will be variable, but mostly affordable. On all days, the average price will remain below five cents. However, significant variations in daily maximum prices can be expected early in the week.

The most notable price spike of the week will occur on **Thursday**, when electricity prices may momentarily rise up to 17 cents in the morning between 7‚Äì9 o'clock. Thursday also carries a risk of even higher price spikes, reaching up to 20 cents. This price peak is due to exceptionally low wind power production, which will fall briefly below 600 megawatts during the morning.

On **Tuesday**, prices are also expected to rise slightly higher than usual. That day's maximum price is forecasted at nine cents in the morning between 8‚Äì10, but there is a risk of a price spike reaching up to ten cents. This peak is also associated with low wind power production, which will periodically drop to unusually low levels (below 1400 MW) during Tuesday.

The cheapest days of the week will be **Wednesday** and **Sunday**, when average prices will fall below one cent. On Wednesday, the electricity price will be negative at night, reaching as low as -1.5 cents. Sunday will also see negative hourly prices, with the lowest at -0.6 ¬¢. These negative prices are explained by abundant wind generation, which will peak at nearly 6900 MW on Wednesday.

On **Friday**, **Saturday**, and **Monday**, prices will remain moderate without significant fluctuations. On Friday, the maximum price will reach up to 6.6 cents during the morning hours, but there is no risk of price spikes. On Saturday and Monday, electricity will remain mostly below five cents, with no major price variations expected.

Overall, the upcoming week will offer electricity users mostly favorable prices, though attention should be paid to price fluctuations on Thursday and Tuesday mornings.
