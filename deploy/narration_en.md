*The electricity spot price forecast for the coming week highlights significant fluctuations: higher prices on Friday and Saturday are followed by a clear dip on the public holiday, after which the beginning of the week returns to a more stable and affordable price level.*

A maintenance outage is ongoing at the Loviisa 2 nuclear power plant, which began on 4 May 2025 at 17:00 and is expected to end on 8 May 2025 at 12:00. The maintenance break may impact the accuracy of the forecast, as there is limited training data available for such periods.

The electricity price trajectory for the coming week is expected to fluctuate significantly, especially around the weekend. **Friday** is forecast to be the most expensive day of the week, with the average spot price rising to 13.8 cents and peak hourly prices reaching up to 25.2 cents. The highest prices are expected during morning (8–10 am) and evening (6–9 pm) hours. There is a high risk of price spikes during these periods, mainly due to very low wind power production: the day's minimum wind output drops to 139 megawatts, well below typical levels.

On **Saturday**, the price level will decrease, but individual hours can still see elevated prices. The average price will be 9.4 cents, with a maximum of 17.4 cents, especially during morning and early evening hours. Wind power production remains low, which partly explains the higher price expectations.

**Sunday** stands out distinctly from the rest of the week: being a public holiday, electricity demand is expectedly low. As a result, the average price drops to 2.4 cents, and the lowest hourly price even turns negative at -0.7 cents. The cheapest hours occur between late morning and afternoon (10 am–4 pm). At the same time, wind power output rises significantly compared to earlier days, supporting the price decline. The risk of hourly price spikes remains, though the overall price level will be low.

At the start of the week—**Monday** and **Tuesday**—the price level stays moderate, with averages at 5.2 and 5.0 cents. However, peak hourly prices can still exceed 11 cents, especially during morning and early evening periods, but average wind power production is clearly higher than before. On these days, price fluctuations are milder and no major deviations are expected.

On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, electricity price forecasts remain low, with both days averaging around 4.4–4.5 cents. Hourly price variations within the day are smaller than earlier in the week, and wind power production stays at normal or occasionally higher levels throughout the day. Hourly price spike risks are noted for these days as well, but maximum prices remain well below the peaks seen over the weekend.

Thus, the week will see exceptionally large differences between days, especially around the weekend. The highest prices occur on Friday and Saturday, when wind power production is low. Sunday is a clear exception, with both demand and prices dropping to their lowest. Early in the week, the price level stabilizes and remains low through the midweek.
