In the upcoming week, electricity prices will show clear fluctuations. Prices will peak at the beginning of the week, with **Monday** standing out as the most expensive day. Monday's average price is expected to reach 6.4 cents per kilowatt-hour, but at its highest, it could approach 13 cents during morning hours between 8:00 and 10:00. There is also a risk of individual price spikes on Monday, potentially reaching as high as 20 cents per kilowatt-hour.

As the week progresses, electricity prices will decrease clearly. On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, the average price will already drop below four cents. The peak price on Tuesday, around seven cents, will occur around 21:00 in the evening. On Wednesday, the maximum price, also around seven cents, will take place in the morning at 8:00. Both days carry a slight risk of hourly prices increasing up to 10 cents.

**Thursday** is a public holiday, which reduces energy consumption and thus lowers electricity prices. Negative hourly prices will even appear on Thursday, pulling the day's average below one cent. Thursday's lowest hourly price, -1.0 cents, will occur from 16:00 to 18:00 in the afternoon and early evening. Negative hourly prices will also occur on **Friday** and **Sunday**, but Thursday's negative prices will be the lowest of the week.

Moving toward the weekend, prices will remain moderate. On **Saturday**, the average price will rise slightly above Thursday's and Friday's levels but will remain below two cents. On Sunday, prices will again be very affordable, with an average of just 0.4 cents. Both days will maintain low prices without significant risk of price spikes.

Overall, the week's price development clearly shows a contrast between higher prices at the beginning of the weekdays and lower prices toward the weekend. Consumers should particularly note Monday's price variations and the potential hourly price spikes.
