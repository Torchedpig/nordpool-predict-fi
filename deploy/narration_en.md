*In the coming week, electricity prices will fluctuate considerably: Monday will experience high peaks exceeding 15 cents, while Wednesday's prices will plunge into negative territory due to abundant wind power.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is undergoing a maintenance outage. The outage is expected to last from 1 March 2025 at 03:00 until 2 May 2025 at 02:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of electricity price forecasts, as training data from periods of plant maintenance is limited.

Electricity prices will fluctuate significantly in the coming week. According to the forecast, notable price differences between individual days are expected. Especially on **Monday**, electricity prices will rise clearly higher than on other days. The day's average price will be around 9.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, but individual hours are forecasted to exceed 15 ¬¢/kWh. The highest prices will occur in the morning between 08:00 and 10:00, when electricity could cost more than 15 ¬¢. Additionally, the risk of price spikes will be high, and prices could momentarily surge to 20‚Äì40 cents during these hours. Monday's lowest wind power production will drop below 800 MW, partly explaining the elevated price peaks.

On **Tuesday**, the average electricity price will decrease somewhat, but morning hours from 08:00 to 10:00 will still see hourly prices above 13 ¬¢. Tuesday also carries a high risk of price spikes, with electricity potentially momentarily costing 20‚Äì30 cents per kilowatt-hour. During Tuesday, wind power production will significantly increase towards the evening, pushing prices downward, even leading to negative prices during nighttime hours.

On **Wednesday**, electricity prices will drop to the week's lowest levels. The day's average price will remain below half a cent, with negative prices occurring for several hours overnight. Wednesday's exceptionally low price level is explained by unusually strong wind power generation, consistently staying above 3900 MW throughout the day.

On **Thursday**, prices will rise slightly compared to Wednesday, yet the day remains affordable with an average price around four cents. Morning hours between 08:00 and 10:00 will again be the highest-priced, but only slightly above 13 cents.

Moving towards the weekend, electricity prices will remain very inexpensive. On **Friday**, the average price will be around 3.5 cents, but there is some risk of moderate price spikes, with individual hourly rates potentially briefly reaching up to 10 cents. On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, average prices will be extremely low, clearly below two cents. Both days will also experience negative prices, particularly during Saturday daytime and early Sunday morning.
