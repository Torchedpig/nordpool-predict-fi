A risk of price spikes is expected on Thursday. Although the forecast maximum price is 14.1 ¢, prices for individual hours could rise up to 20 cents. The price spikes will likely occur during the morning hours between 8 and 10 AM. Friday's maximum price is 14.2 ¢.

Wind power production will be variable next week. On Saturday and Monday, wind power will be abundantly available, but on Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, the minimum wind power production will remain below 2500 megawatts, which partly explains the higher prices.
