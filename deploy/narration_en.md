Electricity prices will vary considerably over the coming days. Clearly, the most expensive day will be **Wednesday**, when the average electricity price will rise to 9.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. Price fluctuations within Wednesday will be significant, with peak prices approaching 17 cents in the morning hours between 7‚Äì9. Additionally, individual hourly price spikes could reach as high as 20‚Äì40 cents on Wednesday. This high-price scenario is at least partly explained by very weak wind power production, dropping to a minimum of only 311 megawatts in the morning.

On Thursday and Friday, electricity prices will return to considerably lower levels. On **Thursday**, the average electricity price will be just 1.2 cents per kilowatt-hour, occasionally dipping slightly negative. The cheapest hours on Thursday will be in the afternoon between 13:00‚Äì16:00, when electricity prices are around -0.9 cents. On Friday, the average price will remain moderate at 2.6 cents, with the cheapest hours occurring during the early morning.

During the weekend, electricity prices will remain low as well. On **Saturday**, the average price will be 1.7 cents per kilowatt-hour, with prices once again briefly turning negative in the afternoon between 13:00‚Äì15:00. On **Sunday**, prices will rise slightly compared to Saturday, but the average price will still remain relatively affordable at 2.2 cents.

Next **Monday** appears to bring another price spike. Monday's average price will rise to 7.8 cents, and the highest prices will occur between 8:00‚Äì10:00 in the morning, when electricity will cost up to 14 cents per kilowatt-hour. Additionally, individual hourly price peaks on Monday could reach as high as 20‚Äì30 cents. Monday's elevated prices can be partially explained by weak wind power production, dropping below one thousand megawatts at its lowest point.

As next week progresses, prices will stabilize again. On **Tuesday** and next **Wednesday**, prices will remain moderate, around 2.5‚Äì2.6 cents per kilowatt-hour.
