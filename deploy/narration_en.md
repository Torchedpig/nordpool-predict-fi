The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is undergoing maintenance beginning on 1.3.2025 at 03:00. The estimated end of the maintenance is 2.5.2025 at 02:00. This maintenance break may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as training datasets from maintenance periods are limited.

Electricity prices will show significant variation in the coming days. The early part of the forecast period, particularly **Thursday** and **Friday**, will clearly have higher prices compared to the weekend. Thursday's average price expectation is 9.2 cents per kilowatt-hour, with a daily maximum of 13.8 cents. On Friday, prices will peak even higher, reaching up to 16 cents between 7‚Äì9 in the morning. Both days also carry a risk that actual prices might temporarily spike even higher, possibly to 20‚Äì40 cents on Thursday and 20‚Äì30 cents on Friday. These price spikes are primarily explained by exceptionally low wind power production, dipping as low as 469 MW on Thursday and just 250 MW on Friday.

As the weekend approaches, prices will decline significantly. **Saturday** will already be notably inexpensive, with an average price of just 0.2 cents per kilowatt-hour, falling even into negative territory at -1.4 cents during the night. **Sunday** will continue to see even cheaper electricity prices, averaging -0.7 cents. During these times, consumers are effectively compensated for electricity usage during several nighttime and early morning hours.

The affordable price level will continue into the beginning of next week. **Monday's** average price remains low at around 2.2 cents per kilowatt-hour, and hourly prices will stay moderate. Also, on **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, price levels will remain low, with average prices of 1.2 and 1.9 cents respectively. Both days will also see negative prices, particularly Tuesday afternoon and early Wednesday morning.

Wind power's role will clearly stand out throughout the week. The low wind power levels on Thursday and Friday will be a key reason for the high price spikes. However, from Saturday onward, wind power production will recover significantly. On Sunday and Monday, average wind power generation will rise clearly above the 5000 MW level, keeping electricity prices extremely low.

Overall, electricity prices in the coming days will fluctuate notably, mainly due to variations in wind power production. Early in the week will be clearly more expensive, while the weekend and beginning of next week offer affordable or even negative prices for electricity consumers.
