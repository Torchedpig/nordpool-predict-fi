*Electricity exchange prices will fluctuate significantly in the coming days: after high prices on Thursday and Friday, electricity rates will fall to negative levels during the weekend, partly due to abundant wind power production.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The maintenance started on 1 March 2025 at 03:00 and is forecasted to end on 2 May 2025 at 02:00. The maintenance outage might affect the accuracy of price forecasts, as training data available during such periods is limited.

The forecast was updated on Wednesday at 14:18.

The price forecast for the coming week shows clear day-to-day differences. On **Thursday** and Friday, prices will reach their highest levels and fluctuate widely. On Thursday, the expected daily average price is 11.2 cents per kilowatt-hour, with hourly prices expected to range between 1.7 and 27.7 cents. Thursday's highest price, 27.7 ¬¢, is forecasted between 18:00 and 20:00. Friday's average price is slightly lower (9.1 ¬¢), but wide fluctuations continue, ranging from 0.3 cents up to 17.2 cents. On Friday, there is also a high risk of price spikes, potentially causing hourly prices to momentarily rise between 20 and 40 cents.

The weekend will bring exceptionally low prices, some even negative. On **Saturday**, the average price will be only 0.3 cents, with prices ranging from -1.2 to 3.1 cents. On **Sunday**, the average price will be even lower at -0.1 cents, with fluctuations between -1.9 and 1.8 cents. Negative prices imply that electricity producers will pay consumers for the electricity they consume.

Next **Monday**, the price level will be moderate, averaging 2.2 cents with variations from 0.8 to 4.3 cents. Neither **Tuesday** nor **Wednesday** is expected to experience significant price fluctuations. Tuesday's average price is forecasted to be around 1.7 cents, while Wednesday's prices are expected to remain around two cents on average.

The high prices on Thursday and Friday are clearly related to low wind power production. On both days, minimum wind power output remains below 500 MW. Conversely, strong wind power production on Saturday and Sunday partly explains the exceptionally low price levels and negative prices.

Overall, significant day-to-day differences characterize the coming week's forecast. Early-week high prices contrasted with late-week low prices vividly illustrate the significant role wind power variability plays in the formation of electricity prices.
