Throughout the upcoming week, electricity prices will mostly remain low. However, clear differences exist between days, particularly during certain hours. Especially high prices are anticipated for **Tuesday**, when the average electricity price will rise close to four cents per kilowatt hour. On **Tuesday** morning between 8:00‚Äì10:00, electricity prices may spike to over 15 cents, with the risk of individual hourly peaks up to around 20 ¬¢.

Similarly, on **Thursday**, the average electricity price will exceed four cents, with the maximum price reaching nearly 10 cents between 8:00‚Äì10:00 in the morning. The price increase on **Thursday** will be particularly due to low wind power generation, which at certain moments during the day will fall below 1400 megawatts.

The cheapest days of the week overall will be **Saturday**, **Friday**, and **Sunday**. On **Saturday**, the average electricity price will even dip slightly negative, with clearly negative prices at individual hours during the night and afternoon, reaching as low as -2.6 cents. **Friday** is a public holiday, during which lower energy demand may further decrease electricity prices. This is reflected in the forecast, as the day's average price will be only 0.6 cents.

In the early week on **Monday** and midweek on **Wednesday**, electricity prices will remain moderate, around two cents. On **Monday**, wind power generation will be abundant, helping to keep prices low. On **Wednesday**, wind power generation will be close to average and will not significantly affect the price level.

Overall, the week will offer mostly affordable electricity prices, but consumers should prepare for higher-priced periods on **Tuesday** and **Thursday**. Specifically, morning hours on **Tuesday** could see significantly elevated prices, making it possibly beneficial to schedule consumption for other times.
