Electricity price expectations will vary significantly over the coming week. Both inexpensive and more expensive days are in store.

On **Thursday** and Saturday, the average price of electricity on the exchange will remain at a very affordable level, around two cents per kilowatt-hour. Average prices will be clearly higher on Friday and **Sunday**, around six cents. On Sunday, there is also a risk of price spikes, with prices for individual hours potentially rising up to 20 cents. The price peak is likely to occur in the evening between 6 PM and 8 PM.

On **Monday**, the average price of exchange electricity will rise to a clearly more expensive level, over 12 cents. A high risk of price spikes is also forecast for Monday, up to 30-50 cents per kilowatt-hour. The price peak is likely to occur in the morning between 7 AM and 9 AM. On next **Tuesday** and Wednesday, the average price will settle around 10 cents. A risk of price spikes is also forecast for Tuesday and next Wednesday: the price of electricity may temporarily rise to 30-40 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Tuesday, the price peak will most likely occur in the morning between 7 AM and 9 AM, and next Wednesday in the morning between 8 AM and 10 AM.

On Saturday, wind power will be available in very large quantities, on average almost 5000 megawatts, which will push prices down. On Monday, Tuesday, and next Wednesday, on the other hand, significantly less wind power will be available, on average only about 1300-2300 megawatts. This partly explains the higher prices. Especially on Monday, Tuesday, and next Wednesday, the low minimum production of wind power, below 2000 MW, may increase prices.

At the beginning of next week, the temperature will remain around zero. Towards the end of next week, the temperature will drop slightly below freezing, with the coldest temperature on Wednesday at -3.5 degrees.
