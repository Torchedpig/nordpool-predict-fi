Electricity prices on the exchange are expected to fluctuate during the coming week. On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, average prices will be higher, while at the weekend and the beginning of next week, prices will fall significantly.

On **Wednesday**, the average price of electricity on the exchange will be 7.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. The price will vary during the day from 1.1 cents to 14.8 cents. Individual price spikes are expected on Wednesday, up to 20 cents per kilowatt-hour. The risk of price spikes will be in the evening, around 6-8 PM. **Thursday** will be the most expensive day of the week, with the average price rising to 10.0 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Thursday, too, there is a risk of individual price spikes, up to 20 cents, most likely in the evening around 6-8 PM. The rise in prices is partly explained by the low level of wind power: on Thursday, wind power production will remain at a minimum of only 1244 megawatts during the day. On **Friday**, the average price of electricity on the exchange will be 9.1 ¢/kWh, and even then there is a risk of individual price spikes, up to 20 cents per kilowatt-hour.

**Saturday** will be significantly cheaper, with an average price of 4.6 ¢/kWh. Between Saturday and Sunday night, the price of electricity is likely to fall close to zero. On **Sunday**, the average price will be only 3.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. Sunday's cheapest hours will be in the early morning and morning, when the price may be just over one cent. On Sunday, wind power will be abundantly available, with an average of 4819 megawatts.

Next **Monday** and **Tuesday**, the average price of electricity on the exchange will be 3.4 ¢/kWh. Between Monday and Tuesday night, the price may even go below zero. Negative prices are expected on Tuesday. Wind power will be abundantly available on Monday and Tuesday, which partly explains the low prices.
