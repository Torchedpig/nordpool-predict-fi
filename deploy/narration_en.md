The electricity market price outlook for the week appears moderate, but there may be exceptionally high hourly prices on individual occasions. According to the forecast, **Thursday** will see the highest average price of the week at 4.6 cents, with the day's maximum reaching 8.5 cents. At the same time, wind power production will be at its lowest on Thursday, which explains both the higher average and maximum prices. The minimum wind power production for Thursday is only 522 MW, which coincides with the day's price peak in the morning hours (8–10 a.m.). A significant risk of price spikes is also noted in the forecast, with prices potentially reaching up to 10 cents on single hours, especially on Thursday.

**On Wednesday**, the average electricity price will remain somewhat lower, around 3.6 cents, but there will be notable intraday variation. Price peaks are expected between morning (8–10 a.m.) and evening (8–10 p.m.) hours, when the price can rise above six cents. Wednesday also carries a risk of price spikes, so hourly prices may be considerably higher than the forecasted maximum.

Over the weekend, **Saturday** and **Sunday** will see clearly lower average electricity prices, especially on Sunday, when the expected average price is only 1.8 cents. Sunday is a public holiday, reflected in low demand and exceptionally low prices. Negative hourly prices are also forecast for Sunday: during the early morning hours (12–4 p.m.), the price will drop as low as -0.9 cents. Both weekend days also carry a risk of price spikes, with hourly prices potentially rising well above the table's maximum.

**Friday** and **Monday** will keep average prices below five cents, but on Monday, single hours—such as mid-morning (9–11 a.m.)—may approach seven cents. On Tuesday, the variation continues: the average price is about 3.3 cents, with substantial hourly fluctuations. According to the forecast, Tuesday again poses a risk for price spikes, especially around 8–10 p.m.

On average, next week's electricity prices will remain low, but especially on Thursday and during certain morning and evening hours, considerably higher prices can be expected. Wind power production will vary day by day, and low levels on Thursday will drive up both the day's average and maximum prices.
