Next week's electricity pricing forecast shows moderate average rates. Daily average prices will remain under five cents, indicating a relatively affordable price level throughout the week. However, price fluctuations between days are notable.

At the beginning of the week, on **Monday**, price volatility will be most significant. On that day, the average electricity price will be 3.9 cents per kilowatt-hour, but hourly prices will vary considerably, ranging from 0.3 cents up to as high as 13.4 cents. The week's highest individual hourly price will occur on Monday morning between 7 and 9 a.m., when prices will exceed 13 cents. Additionally, Monday carries a risk of price spikes, potentially pushing hourly prices momentarily above the forecasted 10-cent maximum.

On **Wednesday**, the price level will also rise higher compared to other days. The day's average is forecasted at 4.3 cents. The highest price on Wednesday will occur in the morning hours from 7 to 9 a.m., approaching nearly ten cents. Wednesday also has a potential risk of price spikes, during which hourly rates could rise even higher than 10 cents.

Thursday is a public holiday. Due to this, electricity demand may be lower than usual, which could reduce prices. On Thursday, the average price will remain below one cent, with negative hourly prices occurring during the day. The lowest hourly price on Thursday will be -1.0 cents in the afternoon from 2 to 4 p.m.

Throughout the week, negative prices will occur on several days, especially during nighttime. For example, on **Saturday** and **Tuesday** nights, electricity prices will momentarily drop below zero, meaning producers will pay consumers to use electricity.

Overall, the week ahead will offer affordable electricity prices despite occasional higher price spikes. Price fluctuations will remain moderate, and the week will not be exceptional regarding average prices.
