The upcoming week brings varying electricity prices in the Finnish market. **Wednesday** will see low price expectations, with an average price of 2.7 ¢/kWh, making it the cheapest day of the week. Prices are expected to range between 0.1 and 6.5 cents, supported by higher wind power production.

On **Thursday** and **Friday**, the average price rises to 7.9 ¢/kWh. Notably, Thursday sees significantly higher wind power production compared to Friday, yet prices remain similar. On Friday, there is a warning of potential price spikes, with prices possibly reaching up to 20 ¢ during specific hours, particularly in the evening, around 16:00-18:00.

**Saturday** sees a slight drop in the average price to 5.8 ¢/kWh. Higher wind power production helps keep prices in check. The weekend continues on Sunday with slightly higher prices, averaging 7.1 ¢/kWh, though price fluctuations remain relatively moderate.

At the start of next week, **Monday** maintains a similar average price to Sunday, at 7.3 ¢/kWh. However, on Tuesday, the highest average prices of the week are forecasted, at 9.0 ¢/kWh. Especially on Tuesday, there is a need to prepare for potential price spikes, as prices could rise to 20-40 ¢ during specific hours, likely occurring in the morning, particularly between 07:00-09:00, or in the evening, around 17:00-19:00. The generally low wind power production partly explains this high price level.
