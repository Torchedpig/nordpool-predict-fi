The electricity price forecast for the coming week shows variation. Prices will be at their highest on **Wednesday**, when the average price for the day is expected to be 18.6 ¢/kWh. Wednesday's highest price is likely to be in the evening between 6 and 8 p.m., when the price could rise up to 29.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. Wednesday's price level is explained by low wind power production, as wind power is predicted to be available only 116-792 MW. Also the hard frost, -4.3 degrees, will increase the price.

On **Thursday**, the average price of exchange electricity is expected to settle at 14.7 ¢/kWh. Thursday's highest price, 19.8 ¢, is likely to be during the morning hours 9-11. Wind power production will remain low on Thursday (150-742 MW) and average temperature is -3.3 degrees. It should be noted, however, that Thursday is forecast to have a high risk of price spikes, with prices for individual hours potentially rising as high as 30-60 cents.

**Friday** is forecast to have an average price of 8.3 ¢/kWh. Friday's highest price, 16.3 ¢, is likely to be in the morning hours 7-9. On Friday, wind power production will increase, but in the morning hours production will still be low, which may explain the higher price. Friday is also forecast to have a high risk of price spikes: prices for individual hours could rise as high as 20-30 cents.

Towards the end of the week (**Saturday** and **Sunday**) the price of exchange electricity will fall significantly. The average price is expected to be 2.7 ¢ on Saturday and 3.4 ¢ on Sunday. On both days, wind power will be abundant, which explains the low price level. On Sunday, the cheapest hours of the day will be in the early morning hours 2-4, when the price could go as low as 0.5 cents.

Next **Monday**, the average price of exchange electricity will rise slightly, to 5.1 cents per kilowatt-hour. Monday's highest price, 9.6 ¢, is likely to occur in the morning hours 9-11. Next **Tuesday**, exchange electricity will be the cheapest of the week, with an average price of only 1.9 ¢. On Tuesday afternoon, between 1 and 3 p.m., the price will even fall below zero, being at its lowest -0.3 ¢.
