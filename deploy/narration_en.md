Electricity prices for the coming week will generally remain affordable. Throughout the week, the price level will predominantly stay below five cents per kilowatt-hour. There will be occasional negative-price hours during several nights and early mornings, especially on the night leading into **Friday**, when the price is expected to drop as low as -1.4 cents.

Weekend days, **Saturday** and **Sunday**, will be particularly inexpensive. On both days, average prices will be close to zero, showing minimal fluctuation. The weekend's highest price point, around 1.9 cents, will occur at seven o'clock on Saturday evening.

Price levels will rise slightly as the new week begins. **Monday** will be the week's first day with a notable increase, averaging around 3.3 cents. The day's peak hourly price of approximately seven cents is expected around eight in the morning. Nevertheless, overall price levels will remain moderate, with no unusually high price spikes anticipated.

On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, electricity prices will continue to stay at low levels. Tuesday's average price will be around one and a half cents, and Wednesday's slightly above two cents. Wednesday's price peak, around 6.3 cents, is expected in the late evening between 20:00 and 22:00.

Clearly, the week's most expensive day will be **Thursday**, when the average price will rise to 4.3 cents. The week's highest price peak, at 7.8 cents per kilowatt-hour, will occur around nine in the morning. Additionally, there is a risk on Thursday of even higher price spikes, potentially reaching up to ten cents per kilowatt-hour for individual hours.

Thus, prices will remain moderate throughout the week, but electricity consumers should pay attention on Thursday morning, when prices will be at their highest.
