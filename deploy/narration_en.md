The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The outage began on 1 March 2025 at 03:00 and is expected to last until 28 April 2025 at 01:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of this forecast, as historical data during outage periods is limited.

Electricity prices will fluctuate considerably over the coming week. According to price forecasts, **Thursday** will stand out with the highest daily average price, at 16.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. Prices on Thursday will also vary greatly, with the lowest hourly price forecasted at 5.3 cents and the highest at 28.2 cents. An actual price spike on Thursday could exceed the forecasted maximum significantly, potentially reaching 40–60 cents. This peak is expected to occur in the morning between 8:00 and 10:00.

On **Wednesday**, price fluctuations will also be significant. Wednesday's forecasted maximum price will reach 30.8 cents, with a high risk of price spikes especially in the morning hours between 8:00 and 10:00. During these spikes, prices may momentarily rise up to 50 cents per kilowatt-hour. However, Wednesday's average price will be slightly lower than Thursday's, at 13 cents.

On **Friday**, the daily average price will be nearly 10 cents, and intraday variation will be considerable: electricity will be cheapest at only 1.6 cents, but at the most expensive hours, prices will exceed 20 cents. There is also a risk of price spikes on Friday, potentially doubling the forecasted maximum and rising up to 40 cents. This risk primarily affects morning hours.

The weekend will begin affordably, with electricity prices staying low throughout **Saturday**. Saturday's average price is 5.4 cents, and the day's lowest hourly price will be just 0.3 cents. Prices will rise again on Sunday, with an average price of 9 cents. However, Sunday's highest hourly rates will be moderate compared to earlier in the week, topping at 15.5 cents. Still, Sunday also carries morning and evening risks of price spikes, which could momentarily reach as high as 40 cents.

The start of the following week, **Monday** and **Tuesday**, will again offer lower electricity prices. Monday's average will be 6.5 cents and Tuesday slightly lower, at 5 cents. Nevertheless, on Monday there remains a risk of price spikes, especially in the morning and evening, when prices could briefly rise to 20–30 cents. On Tuesday, this risk is minimal, with no mention of price spikes in the forecast.
