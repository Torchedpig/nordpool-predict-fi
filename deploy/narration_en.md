Currently, one significant nuclear power plant maintenance outage is ongoing in Finland. The Olkiluoto 3 plant has halted production entirely due to maintenance. The outage began on 1 March 2025 at 03:00, and it is expected to end on 2 May 2025 at 02:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of electricity price forecasts, as training data during nuclear plant maintenance outages is limited.

The electricity price forecast for the coming week shows clear day-to-day variations. The cheapest day of the week will be **Sunday**, when the daily average price will drop close to zero, and the lowest hourly price will even reach -2.2 cents. Early in the week, **Monday** and **Wednesday** will also be affordable days, with daily average prices below two cents.

Clearly, the most expensive day will be **Thursday**, when the average price is expected to rise to 4.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. Thursday’s highest prices will occur in the morning between 8–10 AM, when prices will approach ten cents. Thursday also carries a risk of temporary price spikes, when single-hour prices may increase up to 10 cents above the scheduled maximum.

Prices will also rise notably on **Tuesday**. On Tuesday, the average electricity price will be around 3.9 ¢, but in the morning between 7–9 AM and in the evening between 7–9 PM, prices may climb considerably higher, even up to 12.3 cents. Tuesday also carries a risk of temporary price spikes, with hourly prices potentially surpassing the forecasted maximum by as much as 10 cents.

Wind power production will vary throughout the week, influencing electricity price developments. On Tuesday, wind power generation will at times be very low, dropping to as little as 576 MW, indicating calm weather. This extremely low minimum wind power production is a key reason behind Tuesday’s high peak prices and the risk of price spikes.

Towards the end of the week, on **Friday** and **Saturday**, prices will remain moderate, partly due to reduced electricity consumption during Friday's public holiday. Nevertheless, Saturday will also carry a slight risk of single-hour price spikes, when prices may temporarily exceed the forecasted levels.
