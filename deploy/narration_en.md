The electricity price forecast for the coming week clearly stands out on **Monday**, when the average price will be around 5 ¬¢/kWh. Throughout the day, prices will fluctuate significantly, ranging from below one cent to over 16 cents during the morning hours between 8‚Äì10. Wind power production on Monday is expected to be very low on average, explaining the high maximum price and substantial intraday variation. The risk of price spikes will be particularly high on Monday morning.

On other days of the week, the average electricity price will remain considerably lower. From Tuesday to Sunday, average prices will stay below two cents, indicating affordable electricity prices. This low price level is mainly due to abundant wind power production, pushing prices downward.

Friday, in particular, will see substantial wind power availability, averaging over 4000 MW, resulting in negative prices during night and early morning hours. However, the week's lowest individual price point will occur on Saturday afternoon, when prices will drop to as low as -1,4 cents. Negative prices will also appear on Sunday and Thursday, typically during nights or afternoons.

Prices will remain affordable on Tuesday and Wednesday, although Wednesday's peak price will momentarily approach nearly five cents between 8‚Äì10 in the morning. Nevertheless, this peak remains moderate compared to Monday's situation.

On Thursday, prices will remain stable and very low throughout the day, similar to Friday when abundant wind power will keep prices low during most of the day. On Saturday, the week's largest negative price spike will occur between 14‚Äì16 in the afternoon, with prices going as low as -1,4 cents. This afternoon period will be the week's most favorable time for inexpensive electricity.

Overall, the week will be inexpensive except for Monday, when price fluctuations will be significant and the risk of price spikes notable. Generally, the week's price level will remain low and stable, offering electricity users good opportunities for affordable usage.
