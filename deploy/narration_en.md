Exchange electricity price expectations are mostly affordable for the coming week. Especially on **Monday** and **Tuesday**, the price of electricity is likely to fall below zero at night. The average prices for the whole week are likely to remain well below five cents per kilowatt-hour, except for Friday.

Next **Friday**, the average price of electricity is expected to rise to 6.7 cents per kilowatt-hour, and the highest price forecast for the day is 14.6 ¢. There are also individual hours predicted for Friday when the price of electricity could rise up to 20 cents. Most likely, these price spikes will occur in the evening, around 6–8 PM. The higher prices on Friday compared to other days are partly explained by the fact that wind power is predicted to be significantly weaker then.

On other days, the price of electricity will remain moderate, and no major fluctuations are expected. For example, the price forecasts for Wednesday and Thursday are very similar, and the average prices are expected to be around four cents.

Although some sub-zero temperatures are expected on **Sunday**, the temperature is not expected to significantly affect the price of electricity. The coming days will therefore offer mostly affordable exchange electricity, except for Friday.
