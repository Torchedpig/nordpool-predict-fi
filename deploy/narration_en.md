*Electricity prices will remain affordable in the coming days, but daily fluctuations will be significant: Friday will be the week's most expensive day, with the largest price variations occurring in the morning. Over the weekend, electricity will be nearly free, and strong wind power mid-next week will keep prices low.*

Olkiluoto 1 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. Maintenance began on 11.5.2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 22.5.2025 at 18:00. The maintenance break may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data from maintenance periods is limited.

The electricity price forecast for the coming days shows considerable daily variation. Overall, however, the week's average prices will remain clearly below five cents per kilowatt-hour, indicating an affordable price level.

The most notable day will be **Friday**, when the average price will rise to around 2.9 cents, with the highest hourly price reaching as much as 11.4 cents during the morning between 7:00 and 9:00. On the same day, wind power production will momentarily drop significantly, to around 559 megawatts, explaining the highest peak price. Additionally, Friday carries a risk of price spikes during individual hours.

The weekend will be markedly cheaper than Friday. On **Saturday**, electricity prices will mostly hover around zero, with an average of just 0.1 cents. The lowest hourly price will be -1.2 cents in the afternoon between 15:00 and 17:00. **Sunday's** average price level will be very close to Saturday's, at around 0.2 cents, but there will be a risk of occasional hourly price spikes.

At the beginning of next week, prices will see a modest increase. On **Monday** and **Tuesday**, price variation will be somewhat higher, with peak hourly prices exceeding five cents on both days. On **Monday**, the maximum price of 5.2 cents will occur in the evening between 18:00 and 20:00, again with the possibility of price spikes. Tuesday's level will remain similar, but without a significant risk of exceptional spikes.

Mid-week, on **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, electricity prices will once again decrease to near-zero levels. These days will see abundant wind power availability, averaging nearly 3300 MW on Wednesday and over 3900 MW on Thursday. This strong wind power production clearly explains the low prices on these days.
