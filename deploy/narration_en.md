Significant fluctuations will be visible in electricity price forecasts for the coming week, and especially on individual hours prices may rise unusually high. Notable are the potential price spikes on Tuesday, Sunday, and next Monday.

On **Tuesday**, the average price for the day is forecasted at six cents, but the price during individual hours may rise exceptionally high. On Tuesday morning between 8 and 10, electricity prices could reach over 16 cents per kilowatt hour, which would be the week's highest single-hour price. This is partly explained by temporarily low wind power availability, around only 650 MW during these morning hours.

From **Wednesday** to Saturday, prices will remain very low, occasionally even becoming negative. On Wednesday, the average electricity price will be just 0.4 cents, with electricity being free or negatively priced on several night and morning hours. Thursday will be even cheaper, with the day's average price practically dropping to zero and nighttime hours again seeing negative pricing. Friday and Saturday average prices will also remain low, barely exceeding one cent.

On **Sunday**, prices will begin to rise again, and particularly between 19:00 and 21:00, prices are expected to clearly exceed five cents. The day's maximum price, according to forecasts, will be as high as 6.6 cents. On Sunday, the minimum wind power level is also momentarily very low, partly explaining higher evening prices.

Next **Monday's** prices will remain moderate, although certain individual hours will again be pricier than the rest of the day. The day's forecasted average price is slightly above three cents, and no notable extremes are indicated, even though afternoon and evening prices will be somewhat higher than average.

Throughout the coming week, there will be a clear correlation between wind power production and electricity prices. When wind power availability is abundant, prices remain low or negative. Conversely, temporary calm periods can quickly push prices to higher levels.
