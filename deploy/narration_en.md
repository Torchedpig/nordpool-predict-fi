The price of electricity on the exchange will be low at the beginning of the week, but the price will turn upwards towards the end of the week. On Wednesday and Thursday, price expectations are very low, and on Wednesday, electricity will even be available at a negative price for a few hours at night.

On **Friday**, the average price will rise to 6.6 cents per kilowatt-hour, and the intraday variation will be large. The rise in prices on Friday is explained by a sharp decrease in wind power production: on Friday, an average of 2593 MW of wind power will be available, while in the preceding days, production has been over 4000 MW. Friday's highest price, 12.9 ¢, will be in the evening between 5 PM and 7 PM.

On Saturday and Sunday, the average prices of electricity on the exchange will settle below three cents per kilowatt-hour. The low prices are explained by the abundant wind power forecast for Saturday and Sunday, which is expected to rise above 4000 MW on both days.

Next **Monday** and **Tuesday**, electricity prices will jump significantly. The average price for Monday is expected to be 8.6 ¢ and for Tuesday 8.4 ¢. The maximum prices for Monday and Tuesday will rise above 10 cents, and a maximum price of 15.2 cents has been forecast for Monday. On Monday and Tuesday, wind power production will decrease significantly from the weekend's figures, which partly explains the rise in prices. In addition, the light frosts forecast for Monday and Tuesday may increase the price of electricity.

On Monday, there is also a risk of higher price spikes than on Sunday. The prices of individual hours can rise up to 20-40 cents per kilowatt-hour. The price spike is most likely to occur between 6 PM and 8 PM. There is also an increased risk of price spikes on Tuesday, up to 20 cents.
