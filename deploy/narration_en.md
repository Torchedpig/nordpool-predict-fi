During the coming week, electricity prices will generally stay at affordable levels, yet with some variation between days. The lowest daily average will occur on **Sunday**, when the average price will dip into negative territory (-0.4 ¬¢/kWh). At its lowest, Sunday's electricity price will reach -1.9 cents around 14:00. **Monday** will also see a negative average price (-0.3 ¬¢), though hourly prices will hover near zero.

The highest average price of the week will be on **Wednesday**, with an average of 2.1 cents per kilowatt-hour. The day's maximum price, nearly five cents (4.9 ¬¢), will occur in the morning hours between 7:00 and 9:00. Prices will also be somewhat elevated on **Friday**, peaking at 3.4 cents between 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning.

**Saturday** will experience significant price fluctuations, ranging from -1.3 cents up to 3.7 cents. The maximum price will be reached in the morning between 7:00 and 9:00. On the same day, minimum wind power production will be relatively low (844 MW), partly explaining the rise in peak prices and increasing the risk of price spikes during certain hours.

Wind power generation will vary notably; especially on Saturday and Wednesday, average production will fall below 2500 MW, possibly contributing to higher prices on these days. Conversely, Thursday, Friday, and Tuesday will see abundant wind power production, supporting lower price levels.

Overall, the upcoming week's price level will remain low despite clear variations between individual days and hours. The risk of price spikes will be particularly notable during morning hours on Saturday and Wednesday.
