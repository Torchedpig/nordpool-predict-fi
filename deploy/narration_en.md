The price forecast for exchange electricity shows mostly affordable figures for the coming week. Only **Monday's** average price will rise to 4.5 cents, and the highest price of the day may rise to 9.6 cents per kilowatt-hour.

The higher price on Monday is due to the low amount of wind power. On Monday, wind power production will remain below 2000 megawatts during the day, which will raise the price.

On other days, the price of electricity will settle below three cents per kilowatt-hour. Particularly affordable days are **Saturday** and **Wednesday**, when the average price is only 0.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Wednesday, the price of electricity may even fall to -1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. Negative prices are also expected on Tuesday.

During the weekend, the price of electricity will remain low. On Saturday, the price will be at its lowest at -0.1 cents per kilowatt-hour and on Sunday at -0.4 cents. On Saturday, wind power will be abundantly available, which partly explains the affordable price.

Although the price of exchange electricity will be mostly affordable during the coming week, except for Monday, the maintenance outage at Olkiluoto 3 may affect the accuracy of the forecast.
