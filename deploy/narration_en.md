According to price forecasts for the coming days, the average electricity exchange price will remain relatively low most days. For the majority of the week, the average price of electricity will be clearly below five cents per kilowatt-hour.

The week's most affordable period will fall on **Friday**, when the average electricity price drops close to zero. Prices will even dip into negative territory, reaching as low as -1.1 cents. Prices will also stay moderate on **Saturday** and **Sunday**, when daily averages range between 0.3 and 1.3 cents. On Sunday morning, prices will hit the week's absolute lowest, bottoming out at -2.1 cents around midday.

On **Thursday**, the highest individual hourly price of the week will occur, peaking at 10 cents during the morning hours between 8 and 10 a.m. This is at least partially explained by the low wind power production that morning, which dips below 2000 megawatts at its minimum. However, Thursday's average wind power remains high, keeping the day's average price reasonably low.

However, next **Monday** clearly stands out from other days. Then the forecasted average price will rise to 6.5 cents, with individual hourly prices expected to exceed 15 cents during the evening between 8 and 10 p.m. Monday also includes a noted risk of even higher price spikes, potentially reaching as high as 20–30 cents during certain hours. This is particularly influenced by Monday's low minimum wind power production, just above 1800 megawatts.

On other weekdays, electricity price fluctuations will remain moderate, with no significant hourly spikes over the ten-cent mark. Thus, the week as a whole appears affordable, but next Monday clearly warrants preparation for notably higher evening prices.
