Significant fluctuations in electricity prices are expected in the coming days. The week's highest average electricity price will occur on **Monday**, with an average price reaching 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. Particularly in the morning around 8-10 am, prices are expected to rise close to 15 cents. The actual price spike could be even higher, as there is a risk of peak prices reaching 20-30 cents during individual hours. This is especially due to temporarily low wind power production, which will drop below 1500 MW during the morning.

Another day with potential sharp price increases is **Thursday**. Although Thursday's average price will be around 4.5 cents, peak prices in the morning between 8-10 am may reach nearly 16 cents. Thursday's price spike could also be more severe than forecasted, with individual hourly prices potentially reaching 10-20 cents. Again, low wind power production in the morning, hitting a minimum slightly over 500 MW, is a significant factor.

The lowest electricity prices of the week will occur on **Sunday**, with an average price of only around half a cent per kilowatt-hour. Sunday‚Äôs lowest prices will even be negative, dropping to -1.1 cents during the afternoon between 4-5 pm. Prices will also remain moderate on **Saturday**, averaging around one cent. The low weekend prices are partly due to favorable wind conditions, as wind power production will be strong, averaging over 3000 MW.

Price levels on other days will remain relatively steady. On **Friday**, **Tuesday**, and **Wednesday**, average prices will stay moderate, around 2.4-2.5 cents. These days do not stand out concerning wind power or temperature, and significant price spikes are not expected.

Overall, electricity prices will exhibit considerable variation in the coming days. Consumers should particularly monitor price developments on Monday and Thursday mornings, when electricity usage could momentarily become significantly more expensive.
