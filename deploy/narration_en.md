The price of electricity on the power exchange will increase in the coming week. **Monday** stands out as the most expensive day of the week, with the average price rising to 11.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. Monday's highest price, 17.8 ¢, will occur during the afternoon and early evening hours between 5 PM and 7 PM. Some individual hours on Monday are also forecast to have prices as high as 30-50 cents per kilowatt-hour.

The week's lowest prices will be during the weekend. On **Sunday**, the average price will remain at 5.7 cents per kilowatt-hour, and at its cheapest, electricity will be only 2.8 ¢ during the early morning hours.

The average price for **Saturday** is expected to be 5.8 ¢/kWh. The difference between Saturday and Sunday is small, although the temperature drops from -7.6 degrees on Saturday to -8.8 degrees on Sunday. The low price is explained by the abundant supply of wind power, as on both days wind power is produced at an average of over 3000 MW.

On **Friday**, the average temperature is -5.6 °C, which is the only day of the coming week when the temperature does not drop significantly below freezing. On Friday, wind power will be available variably. The minimum wind power production will remain at 805 megawatts, which partly explains Friday's higher prices in the early evening. It is worth noting for Friday that the prices of individual hours can rise up to 20 cents per kilowatt-hour, even though the maximum price for the day has been forecast at 12.2 ¢.

Next **Tuesday**, the price will turn downward, and the average price will fall below nine cents per kilowatt-hour. Tuesday's price is close to the preceding Monday and the following Wednesday, although more wind power is available on Tuesday.

Next **Wednesday**, the price of electricity will remain at Tuesday's levels, but the intraday variation will be greater. Wednesday's average temperature is -9.3 °C, which is the coldest reading of the week. A risk of price spikes has been forecast for Wednesday, and the prices of individual hours can rise up to 20 cents.
