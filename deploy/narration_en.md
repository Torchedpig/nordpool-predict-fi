In the coming week, electricity market prices will vary significantly from day to day, with especially higher average prices forecasted at the start of the week. **Thursday** stands out as the most expensive day, with an average price of 6.3 cents and a peak of 11.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. On that day, minimum wind power production will drop to a very low 266 megawatts, which clearly explains the elevated maximum price. In addition, Thursday carries a risk of potential price spikes, with individual hourly prices possibly surging up to 20 cents. According to the forecast, these spikes are most likely during the morning and evening hours, for example between 8–10 AM or 6–8 PM.

**Friday** is expected to see a slight decrease in the average price compared to Thursday, but it will still remain above five cents. The price variation throughout the day will be more moderate, yet Friday also carries a risk of individual price spikes, which could momentarily push the price up to 20 cents. Minimum wind power production remains at a low level, which may influence the maximum price.

Over the weekend, prices are expected to turn significantly lower. **Saturday** and especially **Sunday** will be the most affordable days of the week. Sunday is a public holiday, which is reflected in reduced electricity demand and very low prices: the average drops below two cents, and at certain hours, prices even turn negative, reaching as low as -0.6 cents. During Saturday and Sunday, individual hourly price spikes are forecasted, which may temporarily raise the hourly price to 10 cents, but otherwise the level will remain very low.

At the start of the week, namely next **Monday** and **Tuesday**, prices are expected to remain comparatively low. Especially on Tuesday, the average price is projected at just 1.7 cents, and wind power production increases significantly, supporting the favorable price level. Wednesday will see a slight rebound to higher average prices, but price variation remains moderate and wind power production continues to be strong.

Looking at the whole week, the greatest variation occurs on Thursday and Friday, when low wind power combines with the risk of individual price spikes. On the weekend and early in the week, price expectations remain much lower, especially due to Sunday’s public holiday. Negative prices will only appear on Sunday and Tuesday, during night and early morning hours.
