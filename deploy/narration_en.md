*Electricity market prices in the coming week will fluctuate between higher hourly peaks on weekdays and clearly lower rates over the weekend. Price variation is mainly linked to changes in wind power production and the reduced demand on the public holiday.*

The upcoming week appears moderately variable in the forecast, with marked price peaks especially on **Tuesday** and **Thursday**. On both days, high hourly prices are expected: on **Tuesday**, the price will rise to 10.8 cents between 8:00 and 10:00, and on **Thursday**, the maximum will reach 9.4 cents between 9:00 and 11:00. The average daily prices on these days will be close to five cents, which is the highest for the week. Additionally, both days carry a risk that individual hourly prices could spike up to 10 cents if wind production remains below forecast.

**Thursday** is expected to see particularly low wind power production throughout the day, which explains both the higher average and peak prices. The minimum output will drop to only 256 megawatts, coinciding with the highest hourly prices in the morning and late morning hours. **Wednesday** and **Friday** also show a risk of individual price spikes, although the forecasted maximums are 6.7 and 7.2 cents, respectively. On Wednesday, a possible spike may occur between 8:00 and 10:00.

The most affordable electricity rates of the week are expected on **Sunday**, when the average price drops to 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour and the lowest hourly price is even negative at -0.6 cents. This negative price occurs in the afternoon between 14:00 and 16:00. Sunday's low price level is due to both the public holiday's lower electricity demand and moderate wind output. **Saturday** will also see prices well below four cents on average, with the cheapest hours appearing in the morning.

The beginning and end of the week, i.e., **Monday** and **Saturday**, will see prices just under three cents. These days are not forecasted to have especially high individual hourly prices, although a risk of price spikes is still present, albeit clearly lower than midweek.

In summary, the week will include both individual high hourly prices and periods of exceptionally cheap electricity. Especially over the weekend and the public holiday, consumers may benefit from low prices, whereas on weekdays, attention should be paid to potential hourly peaks.
