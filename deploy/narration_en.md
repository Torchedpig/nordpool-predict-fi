This week's electricity price forecast indicates clear variability. Especially **Thursday** stands out with particularly high price volatility. Thursday‚Äôs average price will rise to 16.4 cents, and the highest hourly prices could peak at over 40‚Äì60 cents, expected during the hours of 7‚Äì9 in the morning. Thursday's price peak coincides with the early morning hours when wind power production will be exceptionally low, only around 273 MW. This limited wind production is indeed one of the primary reasons behind Thursday‚Äôs price spikes. Thursday‚Äôs lowest expected price is around three cents, anticipated at the very beginning of the day between midnight and 2:00 am.

On **Friday**, electricity price levels will remain relatively high, with an average price of 11 cents. Friday‚Äôs highest price, 23.8 cents, is expected between 8‚Äì10 in the morning. Significant risks of price spikes are also forecasted for Friday, potentially pushing hourly prices up to 30‚Äì40 cents. Again, these elevated prices are linked to relatively low wind generation in the morning hours, dropping below one thousand megawatts during the early morning.

Approaching the weekend, prices will drop significantly. On **Saturday**, the average price is expected to fall below four cents, and negative electricity prices are even predicted for early morning hours‚Äîespecially between 4‚Äì5 am, when wind power will be abundant, exceeding 4500 MW. Sunday continues the trend of affordable prices, averaging around five cents without significant price fluctuations.

At the start of the new week, on **Monday** and **Tuesday**, prices will rise slightly from weekend lows. However, price levels are expected to remain reasonably moderate, with average prices around seven cents. On individual hours during these days, prices may peak slightly above ten cents, but no significant spikes are anticipated.

Next **Wednesday**, prices will decrease slightly again, with the average price remaining below six cents per kilowatt-hour. Price fluctuations are expected to be minimal, and the day‚Äôs highest prices will remain moderate.
