The price of exchange electricity will rise towards the end of the week, and the most expensive electricity will be on **Thursday**. Thursday's average price, 9.7 ¢/kWh, will be clearly the highest of the week. Thursday's maximum price, 16.4 ¢, will be during the morning hours of 8-10. At that time, there will be little wind power available, at its lowest 1195 MW.

On Thursday, there is a risk that the prices of individual hours will rise to as much as 20-40 cents per kilowatt-hour. It is possible that Thursday's price peak will be in the evening at 5-7 PM.

Also on **Friday**, the average price of exchange electricity, 8.6 ¢, will be close to Thursday's figures. Friday's highest price, 12.5 ¢, will be in the morning at 7-9 AM. Also on Friday, there is a risk that the prices of individual hours will rise to as much as 20 cents per kilowatt-hour. The most likely time for a price peak is in the evening at 6-8 PM.

On **Saturday**, the price will turn downward. The average prices for Saturday and Sunday will be around 4-5 cents. On **Sunday**, there will be plenty of wind power available, which will push the price down.

Next **Monday** and **Tuesday**, the price of electricity will continue to fall. The average price for Monday is forecast to be 3.1 ¢ and for Tuesday only 2.0 ¢ per kilowatt-hour. On Tuesday night, the price will fall close to zero. On Tuesday morning hours, electricity will be very cheap.

This coming week, the price of electricity will therefore vary considerably. On Wednesday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, electricity will be cheap, but on Thursday and Friday, more expensive days are expected.
