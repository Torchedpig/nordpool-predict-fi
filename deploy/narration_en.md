Electricity price expectations for the coming days are variable. Over the weekend, prices will remain mostly low, but on **Sunday**, prices are expected to rise significantly compared to Saturday. The average price for Sunday is forecasted to be 6.3 cents, with a high risk of individual price spikes reaching 20‚Äì30 cents per kilowatt-hour, especially during morning and evening hours. According to the forecast, Sunday's highest price period will occur between 19:00 and 21:00.

The week's highest prices will be observed on **Monday**, when the average price climbs to 11.9 cents. The price variation on Monday will be wide, with individual hourly prices ranging between 2.4 cents and nearly 22 cents. Prices will peak particularly in the morning between 08:00 and 10:00. Additionally, Monday carries a high risk of price spikes, potentially reaching as high as 30‚Äì50 cents per kilowatt-hour at individual hours. Monday's elevated prices are explained mainly by the very low wind power production in the morning and late morning hours, when wind power will be exceptionally low, around only 350 megawatts.

On **Tuesday**, electricity prices will drop sharply back to very low levels. The average price is predicted to be only 1.1 cents, and no price spikes are expected. Prices will remain moderate on **Wednesday** as well, although the average price will rise slightly from Tuesday to 5.2 cents.

Towards the end of the week, prices will be very low. On **Thursday**, the average electricity price will be 0.8 cents, and on **Friday** even lower at 0.7 cents. Both days will see negative electricity prices during certain hours, when electricity producers will effectively pay consumers to use electricity.

Next **Saturday**, the price level will remain very affordable, although slightly higher than on Friday, with an average price of 2.3 cents. The very low prices in the latter half of the week are explained by high wind power production, exceeding even 5000 megawatts.
