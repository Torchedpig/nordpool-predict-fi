Electricity price expectations will vary considerably over the coming week. On **Thursday**, the price will rise to a very expensive level, with the average daily price forecast to be as high as 21.8 ¢. The maximum price on Thursday could rise to 31.1 cents per kilowatt-hour, with the peak price expected in the morning hours, around 10-12 am. Thursday's high price is explained by weak wind power production, which is forecast to remain very low during the day, at only 80 megawatts. The severe frost, -3.3 degrees, will also increase the price.

On **Friday**, price expectations are already significantly lower, with an average price of 10.5 ¢. However, a high risk of price spikes is forecast for Friday, up to 30-40 cents in individual hours. The risk of a price spike is during the morning hours.

On **Saturday**, the price of electricity will fall to a very affordable level, with an average daily price of only 2.8 ¢ expected. During Saturday, the price may even go below zero, to -0.1 cents. On Sunday, the price will remain very low, with an average price of 2.5 ¢. Also on **Sunday**, the price will temporarily fall below zero, to -0.5 cents in the afternoon.

At the beginning of next week, on **Monday** and **Tuesday**, electricity prices will continue to be affordable. Average prices will be less than five cents per kilowatt-hour. Next Tuesday, the price may temporarily fall to less than one cent per kilowatt-hour.

Next **Wednesday**, the price of electricity will rise slightly higher, with the average daily price being 4.9 ¢. A small risk of price spikes is also forecast for Wednesday, and the prices for individual hours may be up to 10 cents higher than the maximum price of 12.3 ¢ forecast in the table.
