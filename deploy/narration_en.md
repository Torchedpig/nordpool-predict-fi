*Electricity prices for the upcoming week will remain mostly affordable, especially during the weekend when prices may even dip below zero. However, electricity consumers should prepare for temporary price fluctuations on Tuesday, as individual morning hours push prices significantly higher than on other days.*

In the price forecast for the upcoming week, **Tuesday** clearly stands out, as electricity prices will fluctuate considerably. The average price on Tuesday is expected to settle around 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour, but individual hours may see significant price variations. Prices will peak on Tuesday morning between 8:00 and 10:00, reaching nearly 18 cents. Lower wind power production during these hours partly explains the high price peaks. Throughout Tuesday, wind power generation will fluctuate notably, dropping to just slightly above 600 megawatts at its lowest.

Starting from Wednesday, electricity prices are expected to decrease notably. The cheapest day of the week will be **Sunday**, when the average price will even fall into negative territory, around -0.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. Thursday, Friday, and Saturday will also remain at very affordable levels, averaging clearly below one cent per kilowatt-hour. On these days, abundant wind power supply will contribute to lowering prices.

Toward the end of the week, electricity prices will stabilize. Next Monday, there will be a slight increase, with the average price rising slightly above two cents. Even then, prices are expected to remain affordable without significant fluctuations.

This week's overall outlook is thus dominated by low prices from Wednesday onward. A notable exception will be Tuesday, when electricity users should prepare for brief periods of higher prices during morning hours.
