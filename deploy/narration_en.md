*Electricity market prices will display significant variations in the upcoming week: the early week provides very affordable hours, even reaching negative prices, but towards the end of the week prices will rise notably higher, peaking on Friday morning at over 14 cents per kilowatt-hour.*

The Olkiluoto 1 nuclear power plant is currently experiencing reduced production. The available capacity is 50 MW, representing 5.6% of its nominal 890 MW output. The production shortfall began on 22 May 2025 at 9:00 and is estimated to end on 24 May 2025 at 1:00. This may affect the accuracy of the price forecast since training data from periods of maintenance breaks and significant production shortfalls is limited.

The following price forecast was updated on Friday at 14:24:

Electricity prices will vary significantly during the coming week. The most affordable days will be **Saturday**, **Monday**, and **Tuesday**, when the expected average price remains clearly below one cent per kilowatt-hour. These days will also include several hours when the electricity price becomes negative. On Monday and Tuesday nights, the price will drop as low as -0.9 cents.

The most expensive day of the week will clearly be **Friday**, with an average electricity price rising to 5.7 cents. That day will also see the highest single-hour price of the week between 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning, potentially reaching as high as 14.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. During this time, the morning consumption peak combined with low wind power production will notably push prices upward.

**Thursday**, which is a public holiday, will also see slightly higher average prices at 3.7 cents. Despite possibly lower electricity consumption on this holiday, prices for individual hours may climb up to nine cents between 19:00 and 21:00.

On **Sunday**, electricity prices will fluctuate considerably throughout the day. Although the average of 3.3 cents is moderate, morning hours between 7:00 and 9:00 will see prices rise as high as 9.4 cents. This is mainly due to very low wind power production, dropping to just 220 megawatts at its lowest during the morning.

Overall, the week's price trend will be divided into two parts. Early in the week, prices remain moderate, whereas towards the end of the week, prices will rise. Particularly the morning hours on Friday could result in individual price spikes, making electricity usage significantly more expensive.
