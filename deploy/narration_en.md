The spot electricity price is forecasted to remain generally affordable during the upcoming week. According to the price forecast, however, there will be some variation between days regarding average prices and price fluctuations.

The lowest prices of the week will be seen on **Thursday**, when the average electricity price will even dip into negative territory, reaching -0,8 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Thursday, electricity prices will range from -2,5 cents to 0,9 cents, driven significantly lower by abundant wind power availability. Also on **Sunday**, the average electricity price will remain negative, averaging -0,6 cents.

The week's clearly highest price spike will occur on **Friday**, when the maximum electricity price will rise as high as nine cents per kilowatt-hour between 08:00 and 10:00 in the morning. This price spike is largely attributable to very low wind power generation, as wind production on Friday morning will fall below one thousand megawatts. Friday's average price of 1,7 cents is the highest daily average price of the week.

On Saturday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday electricity prices will remain moderate. During these days, average prices will range between 0,3 and 1,0 cents. Price fluctuations will also remain relatively small, with no significant price increases anticipated.

Wind power production during the week will mostly remain at typical levels, and temperatures will not deviate from the usual cool spring weather. Thus, these factors will not lead to significant price fluctuations, except for Friday morning‚Äôs low-wind period temporarily elevating electricity prices.
