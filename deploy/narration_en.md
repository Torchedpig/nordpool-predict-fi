There is currently a significant production shortfall at the Olkiluoto 1 nuclear power plant. The plantâ€™s nominal output is 890 MW, but currently only 50 MW is available. Thus, the availability is 5.6 percent. This production shortfall started on 22 May 2025 at 09:00 and is expected to end on 24 May 2025 at 01:00. Forecast accuracy may be affected as training data is limited during such production shortfalls.

In the coming days, electricity spot prices will remain generally affordable, though price fluctuations within individual days may occasionally be significant.
