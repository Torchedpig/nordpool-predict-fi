Electricity prices for the coming week are expected to vary considerably from day to day. The early part of the week will be clearly cheaper, while prices will rise toward the end of the week. From Thursday to Saturday, average daily prices will remain relatively low, around one cent. Saturday will be the week's cheapest day, averaging only 0.5 cents.

On **Sunday**, prices will start to rise, with an average price approaching five cents. The lowest level of wind power production, just over 1200 MW, may partly explain the higher prices. There is also a risk of price spikes on Sunday, potentially reaching up to 10 cents during individual hours. Sunday's highest hourly price is forecasted for the evening between 19:00 and 21:00, approaching nine cents.

The price increase will continue on **Monday**, when the day's expected average price will be the week's highest at 5.2 ¢. Monday also sees the week's highest predicted maximum price of as much as 13.3 cents, occurring in the late morning between 09:00 and 11:00. At the same time, the lowest level of wind production will remain below 1400 MW, partly explaining the high peak price. Additionally, Monday carries a risk of even higher price spikes, potentially rising as high as 20 cents per hour.

On **Tuesday**, prices will return to a lower level, with the day's average price at only 1.3 cents. Wind power production will strengthen significantly then, contributing to lower prices. On **Wednesday**, the average price will again rise close to five cents, but no risk of price spikes has been mentioned in the forecast.

In summary, the coming week will offer variable electricity prices. The week starts with affordable prices, but on Sunday and especially Monday, prices will temporarily rise sharply. Consumers should monitor prices more closely on these days.
