Exchange electricity prices are forecast to remain very low over the weekend. **On Saturday** and **on Sunday**, prices are expected to fall close to zero, with several negative hours, especially at night. The average price will remain at 0.1 cents on Saturday and 0.2 cents on Sunday per kilowatt hour. Strong wind power production explains the cheap rates on these days.

At the start of the week, the situation changes. **On Monday**, the average price rises clearly higher, to 2.9 cents, with significant intraday fluctuations. According to the forecast, prices will stay near zero during the early hours, but from 6 to 10 a.m. electricity prices will climb to the 4–5.7 cent range. In the evening, between 7 and 9 p.m., prices may again exceed five cents. There is also a risk of individual price spikes, where hourly rates could reach up to 10 cents per kilowatt hour. This is due to very low minimum wind production: on Monday, wind power drops momentarily to just 873 megawatts, explaining the higher maximum price and possible spikes.

**On Tuesday** and **on Wednesday**, prices return to more moderate levels. Tuesday’s average price is 2.2 cents and Wednesday’s is 1.7 cents. On both days, the highest prices are seen in the morning and evening, but maximum prices stay below five cents. Wind power production is at a normal level on Tuesday and Wednesday and does not significantly affect prices.

**On Thursday**, the price level drops further, with the daily average at 1.2 cents. The lowest prices dip briefly into negative territory during the early morning hours. Wind power production is slightly lower than at the beginning of the week, but remains within normal range.

**On Friday**, electricity prices climb clearly to the week's highest levels. The average price rises to 4.4 cents, and the daily maximum reaches 7.3 cents. Wind power production is noticeably lower than during the rest of the week, which pushes prices higher. There is also a risk that on individual hours, prices could rise as high as 10 cents per kilowatt hour. The highest rates are concentrated in the morning and evening, especially between 7–9 a.m. and 8–11 p.m.

The cheapest periods of the week will be during the weekend, when abundant wind power pushes prices exceptionally low. The most expensive moments, on the other hand, are forecast for next Friday, when low wind production is set to drive up both average and hourly prices. Price expectations fluctuate clearly during the week in line with changes in wind power generation.
