*The price of electricity on the exchange will fluctuate noticeably from day to day next week: the most affordable moments are expected especially on Sunday and midweek, but individual hours on Monday, Friday, and Saturday may see potential rapid price spikes due to low wind power production.*

During the upcoming week, the exchange electricity price level will vary significantly between days, and especially some individual hours may climb to higher levels. According to the forecasts, the most affordable day will be Sunday, when the average price is expected to remain at zero cents, and at times even dip slightly into the negative. On Sunday, wind power production will be abundant, which explains the exceptionally low price level for the entire day.

Next Monday, the price level will rise considerably, with the daily average reaching 3.5 cents. The electricity price is forecasted to be highest during the morning hours between 8–10 am, when it may climb as high as 7.5 cents. According to the forecast, the minimum wind power output on Monday will fall below 1,000 megawatts, which is clearly lower than on other days and partly explains the higher price level and potential individual price spikes. Similar price spike risks exist on Tuesday, when the average price is around 2.1 cents, but individual hours may still quickly reach up to 10 cents, especially during the morning and evening hours.

In the middle of the week, on Wednesday and Thursday, the electricity price will remain lower. On Wednesday, the average price will be just 1.0 cent, and on Thursday only 1.5 cents. On both days, wind power production will be somewhat higher, and the forecasts show no significant risk of price spikes. On Thursday, a single hour will reach 5.4 cents, but otherwise the price will remain close to a low level.

Towards the end of the week, especially next Friday, the price level will rise again. Friday's average price will climb to 4.2 cents, with the highest hourly prices occurring in the morning and evening. Wind power production will then be at its lowest level of the week, which is clearly reflected in the higher maximum price of 7.0 cents and possibly even up to a 10 cent spike in individual hours. On Saturday, the electricity price will revert to a more moderate level, with the average price at 2.0 cents. However, there will be significant intra-day price fluctuations, and some hours may reach up to five cents or, if spikes occur, even higher.

Thus, the week will include both exceptionally affordable and somewhat more expensive days. The lowest prices will occur during the night and early morning hours on Sunday, while the highest hourly prices will appear on Monday, Friday, and Saturday, especially when wind power is scarce.
