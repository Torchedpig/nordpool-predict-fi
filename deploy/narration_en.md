Electricity prices on the exchange will fluctuate notably during the coming week. The weekend begins with very affordable hours: on **Saturday**, the average price will even dip slightly negative to -0,2 cents. Saturday's most affordable period will be in the afternoon between 13:00 and 15:00, with prices as low as -1,5 cents.

The situation will change significantly on **Sunday**, when the average daily price will rise to nearly six cents. Especially in the evening between 19:00 and 21:00, prices may become notably high—up to 17 cents. The risk of price spikes is considerable, and during individual hours prices could rise as high as 20–30 cents.

**Monday** will be the most expensive day of the week, with the average price exceeding nine cents. The highest prices on Monday will occur in the morning hours between 9:00 and 11:00, when the expected maximum price will surpass 22 cents. The risk of price spikes on Monday is also significant; individual hours could see prices rise as high as 20–40 cents. Monday's high prices are explained by the low minimum wind power availability, dropping below 400 MW.

On **Tuesday**, prices will decrease significantly from Monday, with an average around four cents. However, the risk of price spikes remains, and individual hours might see prices rise up to ten cents. Late evening between 22:00 and midnight, electricity will again be very affordable, even negative.

In the middle of the week, prices will remain moderate. On **Wednesday**, **Thursday**, and **Friday**, the daily average prices will stay below three cents, and the risk of price spikes will not be significant. On **Thursday**, negative prices will again appear in the afternoon between 13:00 and 15:00, as low as -1,5 cents.

Next **Saturday** seems stable and moderate in terms of price development, with the daily average at 2,5 cents without major fluctuations.
