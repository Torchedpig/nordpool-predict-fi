Electricity prices will remain highly affordable during the upcoming week. The average electricity price throughout most of the week will stay significantly below five cents per kilowatt-hour, and even on the week's most expensive day, **Friday**, the average price will only rise to 2.5 cents. Friday may, however, experience brief price spikes in the morning hours between approximately 8 a.m. and 10 a.m., when prices could momentarily exceed 10 cents per kilowatt-hour.

The week's cheapest days will be **Monday**, **Tuesday**, and **Saturday**, when average daily prices will hover around zero or even slightly below. On these days, electricity prices will dip significantly into negative territory during nighttime. For example, between Monday night and Tuesday morning, prices will reach lows of -1.3 and -0.9 cents.

**Thursday** will be a public holiday. Demand for electricity could be lower than usual, which might contribute to maintaining relatively modest prices. Thursday's average price will be slightly above one cent, but individual price spikes may occur in the evening hours between approximately 6 p.m. and 8 p.m., when prices could rise close to four cents.

Wind power production will remain at normal or slightly elevated levels for most of the week, supporting affordable electricity pricing. Particularly strong wind power output will occur on **Monday**, averaging nearly 3500 MW. This abundant wind power supply will help keep prices extremely affordable.

**Sunday** will show the week's greatest fluctuations, both in electricity prices and wind power generation. Wind power production will vary considerably throughout the day, beginning at very low levels and increasing towards evening to over 3000 MW. This large variability in production explains Sunday's wide price range, stretching from negative prices to over seven cents.

Overall, the coming week will offer highly affordable electricity, although there may be significant hourly price fluctuations.
