In the coming week, electricity price expectations will vary considerably. Both very cheap and more expensive days are in store.

On **Saturday**, the price of electricity will remain very low, with an average price of only 1.7 ¢/kWh. During the day, the price will vary between 0.4 cents and 3.0 cents. Very strong wind power production is forecast for Saturday, which explains the low price level.

On **Sunday**, the price will rise somewhat. The average price will be 6.7 ¢, and the intraday variation will be greater than on Saturday, from 1.6 cents to 12.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. A price spike is expected on Sunday, with prices for individual hours potentially rising up to 20 cents.

Next **Monday**, the price of electricity will rise to a clearly more expensive level. The average price for the day is forecast to be 11.0 ¢, and the price could rise to a maximum of 16.9 cents. On Monday, wind power production will be low, averaging only 1279 MW, which partly explains the higher price level. On Monday, it is also advisable to prepare for price spikes: prices for individual hours could rise as high as 30-40 cents, most likely in the morning between 7-9 am or in the evening between 5-7 pm.

Next **Tuesday** will be similar to Monday in terms of pricing. The average price will be slightly lower than Monday's, 10.8 ¢/kWh, but the intraday variation will be similar, from 5.4 cents to 16.4 cents. There is also a high risk of price spikes on Tuesday, up to 30-40 cents per kilowatt-hour.

Next **Wednesday**, the average price of electricity on the exchange will remain at Tuesday's levels (10.8 ¢/kWh). However, Wednesday's forecast has a large price range: the price could be as low as 6.2 ¢, but could rise to a maximum of 20.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. A high risk of price spikes is forecast for Wednesday. Prices for individual hours, most likely in the morning between 7-9 am and in the evening between 5-7 pm, could rise up to 30-40 cents per kilowatt-hour.

Next **Thursday**, a slightly lower price is forecast. The average price will fall to 7.5 cents per kilowatt-hour.
