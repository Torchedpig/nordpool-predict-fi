Next week's electricity spot price forecasts show clear daily variations. Average prices will remain mostly affordable, but on **Monday**, the average price will rise significantly above other days.

**Sunday** will be a public holiday, which typically results in lower electricity demand. This will keep the day's average price low, around 2.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. Prices during the day will fluctuate moderately between 0.5 and 6.7 cents.

On **Monday**, electricity prices will clearly rise to the week's highest level. The average will exceed nine cents, and the day's peak price is forecasted for the morning hours, between 7 and 9 am. At that time, the price is expected to peak at 21.9 cents, significantly higher than other days in the week. The risk of price spikes during individual hours is high.

By **Tuesday**, the situation will calm down, with average prices returning to below four cents. The highest prices will occur during the morning hours but will remain well below Monday‚Äôs levels. However, there remains a risk of isolated price spikes during certain hours.

Midweek, especially on **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, electricity prices will drop significantly. On Wednesday, the average price will be below half a cent, and Thursday's average will remain just above one cent. Both days will witness negative hourly prices, particularly at night.

Forecasts for **Friday** and **Saturday** continue this affordable trend. On Saturday, the average price will reach its lowest level of the week, at just 0.2 cents. Negative prices will again occur briefly during nighttime and early morning hours on these days.
