The price of exchange electricity will remain mostly affordable during the coming week, but price expectations will rise towards the end of the week. Electricity will be most expensive next **Saturday**, when the average daily price is forecast to be 6.9 ¢/kWh. The maximum price on Saturday may rise to 14.6 cents per kilowatt-hour.

On Saturday, there is also a risk that the prices of individual hours will rise to as much as 20-30 cents. This is because wind power is forecast to be weak on Saturday: during the day, production may remain at only 887 megawatts. The peak price is likely to be in the evening, around 6-8 PM.

Next **Sunday** and **Monday**, the price of electricity will settle below two cents per kilowatt-hour. On Sunday, electricity will be particularly cheap: the average price will remain at 1.3 cents, and at night the price will even fall into negative territory. Tuesday will also see a cheap night, with the price reaching -0.9 cents.

Next **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, average prices will rise, but will still remain reasonable. The average price for Wednesday is forecast to be 6.6 ¢/kWh. Wednesday's highest price, 11.3 ¢, will likely occur around noon, between 11 AM and 1 PM.

Next **Thursday** and **Friday**, average prices will settle slightly higher than on Wednesday, above six cents. On Friday, the price of electricity could rise to a maximum of 11.9 cents per kilowatt-hour. Wind power production will remain at a low level on Friday, which partly explains the rise in prices. On Thursday, there is also a risk that the prices of individual hours will rise to as much as 20 cents per kilowatt-hour.
