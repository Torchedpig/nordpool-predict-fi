Electricity prices for the coming week will vary significantly. **Friday** sees the lowest price expectations, with an average price of only 4.9 ¬¢. This is partly explained by strong wind power, averaging 4454 MW. **Saturday**'s prices remain moderate, and on Sunday, slightly higher prices are expected, with the average price rising to 7.3 cents.

Next **Monday** and **Tuesday** prices rise significantly, with a risk of price spikes that could push prices up to 20 cents during certain hours. On both days, the average price remains above 8 cents. **Wednesday**'s prices are the highest of the week, with the average price rising to 9.6 cents. This is partly due to weak wind power, averaging only 1402 MW.

Next **Thursday** prices slightly decrease from Wednesday, but the risk of price spikes continues, which could affect evening prices. The overall picture for the week is one of varying prices, with the price increase particularly notable at the start of the week. üå¨Ô∏è
