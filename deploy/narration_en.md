*Electricity prices for the coming week remain moderate, but Tuesday morning may see high price spikes due to low wind production; the maintenance outage at Olkiluoto 3 may affect forecast accuracy.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is undergoing a maintenance outage, which started on March 1, 2025, at 03:00 and is expected to end on May 2, 2025, at 02:00. The maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data during such outages is limited.

The forecast was updated on Saturday at 09:00.

Electricity prices for the upcoming week will vary notably from day to day. Prices will remain moderate during the holiday days at the beginning of the week, but the price level is expected to rise somewhat as the week progresses. Negative electricity prices will occur especially during the night and early morning hours on **Sunday** and **Monday**.

The cheapest electricity will be on **Sunday**, with an average price around one cent. The lowest prices of the day will occur in the early morning hours between 03:00 and 05:00, when the price will fall slightly below zero, approximately -0.9 cents.

The highest average price of the week will be seen on **Tuesday**, when the daily average electricity price will reach 5.3 cents. At around 08:00, the electricity price is anticipated to peak at 14.1 ¬¢/kWh. Tuesday also carries a risk of price spikes, with individual hourly prices potentially rising as high as 20 cents. This price spike is expected between 07:00 and 09:00 in the morning. Tuesday's price increase is due to exceptionally low wind power generation, dropping to a minimum of just 1136 MW around the morning peak.

There is also a risk of price spikes on **Thursday**, **Friday**, and **Saturday**, when hourly prices may reach as high as 10 cents. Among these days, **Thursday** and **Friday** have more moderate average prices, slightly above and slightly below four cents respectively. On **Saturday**, the average price will drop further to just over two cents, with negative electricity prices appearing again, especially in the afternoon hours between 15:00 and 17:00.

Apart from Tuesday, the other days of the week do not stand out significantly in terms of prices, and average prices generally remain affordable or moderate. The week's price fluctuations are mainly explained by variations in wind power production.
