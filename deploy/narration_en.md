In the coming week, electricity price forecasts indicate clear fluctuations, especially at the beginning of the week. **Sunday** stands out with an exceptionally low average price, remaining at 0.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. Prices also vary between hours, dropping even slightly negative during the morning hours. Strong wind power production explains the low price level on Sunday.

**On Monday**, the average electricity price is expected to rise to 3.6 cents. During the day, minimum wind production drops to an exceptionally low 993 megawatts, which partly explains the higher hourly prices. Particularly in the morning from 7 to 9 a.m. and in the evening from 7 to 10 p.m., the price is expected to be at the highest level of the week, with individual hourly prices possibly exceeding 7 cents. Additionally, there is a risk of individual price spikes, with prices potentially reaching 10 cents.

**Tuesday** brings a slightly more stable price level, with an expected average of 2.6 cents. There are no major fluctuations within the day, and no risk of price spikes has been forecast. Wind power production remains at a moderate level similar to the start of the week.

**On Wednesday**, the average electricity price stays almost at Tuesday’s level, at 2.7 cents. The range between the day's minimum and maximum prices remains moderate. However, individual hours are estimated to be at risk for price spikes up to 10 cents, especially during morning and evening hours.

**On Thursday**, price expectations remain close to the week's average, with the largest intraday fluctuations occurring in the morning, when the price may temporarily rise to 6.6 cents. Thursday also comes with a forecast for possible individual price spikes reaching around 10 cents.

**Friday’s** price level remains similar to Thursday’s, but within the day, clearly higher hourly prices may occur, especially in the morning and early afternoon. There is a risk of individual price spikes up to 10 cents, which may occur between 9 and 11 a.m., for example.

**On Saturday**, the price level drops again to the most affordable level of the week. The average price remains at 1.2 cents, and intraday variation is much more moderate than on other days. Nevertheless, Saturday is also forecasted to have a possibility of individual price spikes up to 10 cents, even though the maximum price in the table stays low.

The most affordable moments of the week are expected on Sunday and Saturday, when strong wind production drives prices down. Higher hourly prices and the possibility of spikes are concentrated at the start of the week, especially during Monday and Thursday mornings and evenings, when wind power production is lower. On average, the electricity price is expected to stay well below four cents throughout the week.
