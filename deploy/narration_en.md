The electricity market prices for the coming days will experience significant fluctuations. The week's highest prices will occur on **Friday**, when the average price exceeds 12 cents per kilowatt-hour. Friday morning between 7‚Äì9 o'clock, electricity prices will peak at as high as 37,8 cents. This elevated maximum price is largely due to the momentary scarcity of wind power during morning hours.

During the weekend, prices will noticeably decrease. On **Saturday**, the average price is forecast to be only 1,7 cents, and during certain nighttime hours, electricity prices will even become negative. The day's most expensive period will occur between 20‚Äì22 o'clock in the evening, reaching 9,1 cents. However, on Saturday, there is a risk of price spikes that could momentarily elevate prices up to about 10 cents.

On **Sunday**, prices will remain relatively low as well, averaging around 3,7 cents. Sunday will also feature negative prices around midday, reaching as low as -1,1 cents. Price spike risks are present on Sunday as well, with potential brief increases up to around 10 cents during individual hours.

At the beginning of the week, prices will remain moderate but slightly higher than the weekend. On **Monday**, electricity prices will peak between 8‚Äì10 o'clock in the morning at 13,6 cents, with the daily average price slightly below 6 cents. Monday also carries a risk of price spikes, potentially reaching as high as 20 cents during certain hours. **Tuesday's** average price will drop slightly from Monday to around 5 cents, with the highest price occurring between 8‚Äì10 o'clock at 10,7 cents. Tuesday also has a risk of hourly price spikes rising up to about 10 cents.

Starting from Wednesday, prices will drop significantly, and on **Thursday**, which is a public holiday, average electricity prices will even turn negative at around -1,3 cents. The lower energy demand typical of a public holiday, combined with strong wind power production, contributes to the reduced price levels. There is no risk of price spikes on Wednesday or Thursday.
