This week’s electricity price forecast highlights a clear contrast between the weekend and the start of the week. **Friday** is expected to be the most expensive day of the week, with the average price rising to 13.6 cents and the highest hourly price reaching 23.1 cents. Wind power production will remain low, especially in the morning and forenoon, resulting in pronounced price spikes. The peak hours on Friday are forecast for between 8:00 and 10:00, when prices are at their highest. Another marked price peak is anticipated in the evening, around 18:00–20:00.

**Saturday** will see the average price drop to 8.5 cents, but individual hourly price spikes are still expected, particularly in the morning and evening. Wind power production will remain low, allowing for variable hourly pricing. The highest prices are forecast for 8:00–10:00 and in the early evening between 19:00 and 21:00.

**Sunday** is a public holiday, when electricity demand is typically lower. This is reflected directly in the price level: the average for the day is expected to be 4.4 cents, with the minimum even dipping below zero to -0.3 cents. However, the risk of price spikes remains for certain hours, especially between 8:00 and 10:00 and again in the afternoon from 13:00 to 15:00, when wind power production is at its lowest.

The beginning of the week brings significantly lower prices. **Monday**’s average is 4.8 cents, with a maximum of 14.4 cents. While hourly price fluctuations continue, wind power production is increasing, which stabilizes the price level. On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, electricity prices remain at their lowest for the week. Tuesday’s average drops to 3.3 cents and Wednesday’s to 3.8 cents. On both days, wind power ramps up toward normal levels, contributing to the price decline. Hourly price swings remain possible.

Next **Thursday**, the electricity price forecast settles at the week’s most affordable level. The average falls to 1.9 cents, and the daily minimum drops as low as -0.9 cents. Wind power remains strong throughout the day, and no price spikes are expected for any single hour.

In summary, Friday and the weekend will be the most expensive periods of the week, while prices drop significantly from the start of the week onward. Thursday, in particular, stands out as the most affordable day. Price variations are mainly driven by fluctuations in wind power production and the lower demand typical of a public holiday.
