The electricity price forecast for the coming week anticipates clear variations between days. **On Saturday**, the average price will rise to 7.4 cents, with wide price fluctuations during the day. There is a risk of price spikes during individual hours, especially in the morning (7–9 a.m.) and evening (6–9 p.m.) when the price may exceed 12 cents. At the same time, wind power production will be exceptionally low, particularly in the early morning, which will raise the day's highest prices.

**Sunday** is a public holiday, which will be reflected in electricity prices. The average price will drop to 5.1 cents, with the lowest hourly price at 1.6 cents. The risk of price spikes remains during certain hours, especially in the evening around 8–10 p.m., when the price may rise close to 10 cents. Wind power production will remain low throughout the day, partly explaining the elevated hourly prices.

At the beginning of the week, **Monday** and **Tuesday** are expected to see electricity prices hover around 5 cents. Both days may feature occasional price spikes, particularly on Tuesday in the morning (8–10 a.m.) and evening (8–10 p.m.), when prices could temporarily exceed 12 cents. Wind power production will increase slightly at the start of the week but not yet reach levels that would significantly lower prices.

**On Wednesday**, the average price will climb to 5.9 cents, and there will be strong price fluctuations during the day, with the maximum price exceeding 11 cents. The risk of price spikes will especially affect the evening, around 5–7 p.m., when prices may rise well above the daily average. Wind power production will remain low.

Towards the end of the week, prices will decrease noticeably. **On Thursday**, the average electricity price will drop to 1.8 cents. The lowest hourly price will even dip into negative territory at night (3 a.m.), falling to -0.1 cents. Wind power production will increase sharply, explaining the low price level throughout the day. No price spikes are expected for Thursday.

**On Friday**, the low price trend will continue, with the average price at 2.6 cents and the maximum price staying at 4.4 cents. Wind power production will remain high all day, supporting the affordable price development. No price spikes are forecasted for Friday either.

The most affordable electricity hours of the week will occur during Thursday night and early morning, when prices may momentarily fall below zero. The most expensive moments are likely to be on Saturday and Tuesday mornings and evenings. In the middle of the week, wind power production remains low, which keeps individual hourly prices high, but towards the end of the week, strong winds will drive prices to a much lower level.
