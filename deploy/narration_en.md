The price of exchange electricity will vary during the coming week. The cheapest days will be **Tuesday** and next **Monday**. The most expensive days are **Wednesday**, **Thursday**, and **Saturday**.

The most expensive day is Thursday, when the average price of electricity will rise to 10.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. Thursday's maximum price will rise to 17.5 cents. The night between Wednesday and Thursday will be the most expensive time of the week: the price of exchange electricity will remain above 10 cents from early Wednesday evening until Thursday evening.

The risk of price spikes is high, especially on Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday. On Wednesday and Thursday, the prices of individual hours can rise up to 30-40 cents. On Saturday, price spikes can rise to 20-40 cents. Most likely, these price spikes will occur during the morning hours 7-9 and evening hours 17-19. On Sunday, price spikes can rise to 20 cents.

Wind power production will vary significantly during the week. On Monday and Tuesday, wind power will be very abundant, which will lower the price of electricity. On Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday, wind power is forecast to be significantly lower, which partly explains the higher prices. On Saturday, the minimum wind power production will remain at only 903 megawatts, which is the lowest figure of the week.

At the beginning of next week, on Monday, a very large amount of wind power is expected, even over 5000 megawatts. Monday's prices will fall very low, and exchange electricity will at times be close to zero during the day.
