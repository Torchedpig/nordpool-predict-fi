This week, electricity prices are expected to vary significantly between days. Price fluctuations will be particularly noticeable on weekdays, which will also see the highest hourly prices.

The most expensive day of the week will be **Tuesday**, with an average price as high as 22.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. Tuesday's maximum price of 37.9 ¢ will occur during the morning between 9:00–11:00. This high maximum price is partly explained by exceptionally low minimum wind power production, only 613 MW.

High peak prices are also forecast for **Wednesday** and **Thursday**. Wednesday's peak price of 31.9 ¢ will occur during the morning between 8:00–10:00. On Thursday, the highest price, 29.0 ¢, will occur at around the same time, between 8:00–10:00. However, both days may experience even higher spikes. On Wednesday, prices for individual hours could momentarily reach 30–50 cents, and on Thursday even 40–60 cents.

On **Friday**, the price level will decrease significantly. The average price for the day will be just over five cents. Nevertheless, even on Friday, there is a risk that individual hourly prices could rise to around 20 cents.

During the weekend, prices will remain moderate. On **Saturday**, the average price will be around seven cents, and the minimum price will briefly drop below one cent. On Sunday, the average price will rise slightly above nine cents. Both weekend days, however, carry a moderate risk of temporary price spikes. On Saturday, hourly prices may rise to around 20 cents, and on Sunday even to 20–40 cents.

Next **Monday**, minor price fluctuations are expected on the electricity market, with the average price remaining slightly above nine cents. The day's forecasted maximum price is 22.3 cents, but the risk of price spikes on individual hours will also be elevated next Monday, potentially reaching between 20–40 cents.
