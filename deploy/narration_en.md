*Electricity prices will mostly remain affordable in Finland next week, but price spikes may occur on Friday, potentially reaching up to 20 cents per kilowatt-hour during individual hours; maintenance outage at a nuclear power plant creates uncertainty in forecasts.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is undergoing a maintenance outage. The outage started on 1 March 2025 at 03:00 and is estimated to end on 2 May 2025 at 02:00. The maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of price forecasts, as training data during outages is limited.

The price forecast was updated on Friday at 21:00.

Next week, electricity prices in Finland will remain generally affordable. However, there will be noticeable differences between days, including significant variation at times. Especially **Friday** stands out with a higher average price of 4.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. Price fluctuations on Friday will be the largest of the week, with daily prices ranging from a negative -0.2 cents up to 11.4 cents. Additionally, Friday carries a high risk of price spikes, when individual hourly prices may rise as high as 10‚Äì20 cents. The peak price is expected to occur on Friday morning, between 08:00 and 10:00.

In the early part of the week, electricity prices will remain very moderate. On **Monday**, the daily average price will be only 1.9 cents per kilowatt-hour. Monday will also see the lowest hourly price forecast of the week, -1.0 cents, occurring during the early morning hours between 03:00 and 05:00. Among the weekend days, **Sunday** will offer negative prices (as low as -0.7 cents), along with the lowest daily average price of the week at 0.4 cents. Sunday's low prices are partly thanks to abundant wind power generation.

On **Tuesday**, prices will rise somewhat higher, with the daily average at 3.7 cents. Tuesday morning between 09:00 and 11:00 will see the week's first notable price peak, potentially reaching as high as 10 cents. This increase is clearly influenced by significantly lower wind power production, dropping below one thousand megawatts during the morning.

On **Thursday**, the price level will settle at a moderate daily average of 2.9 cents. Thursday's price fluctuations will be moderate, with the day's peak price of 7.6 cents expected in the morning between 07:00 and 09:00. On Wednesday, prices will also remain stable and affordable, averaging 2.2 cents for the day.

Throughout the week, negative prices will occur during nighttime and early morning hours, mostly due to abundant wind power production at those times. Electricity users will have good opportunities to take advantage of periods of lower prices, especially overnight and during the weekend.
