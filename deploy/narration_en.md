During the upcoming days, electricity exchange prices will generally remain at an affordable level. Throughout the week, hourly electricity prices will occasionally turn negative, especially during nighttime hours. Overall, daily average prices will vary slightly, but **Monday** will stand out somewhat with its higher average price.

The most affordable days of the week will be **Friday** and **Saturday**, with average prices hovering near zero cents. On both days, prices will occasionally fall into negative territory. For instance, during the early hours of Friday between 01:00 and 03:00, prices will drop to approximately -1 cent. Robust wind power generation on these days will contribute to keeping electricity prices exceptionally low.

On **Sunday**, electricity prices will also remain very low, with an average price of only 0.1 cents. The day will feature negative hourly prices during the night, but prices will rise slightly above one cent in the evening.

Prices will clearly rise from previous days on **Monday**. The day's average will increase to 3.3 cents, peaking at nearly eight cents between 08:00‚Äì10:00 in the morning. Wind power production will still be moderate, though significantly lower than on the weekend, partly contributing to the rise in prices.

On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, there will be risks for occasional price spikes. Although the forecasted maximum price for Wednesday is 5.7 cents and for Thursday 2.7 cents, individual hourly prices on both days could potentially increase up to 10 cents. Wednesday's somewhat lower wind power forecast (minimum 1402 MW) may partly contribute to price increases during the day.

Overall, the week's electricity prices will not show substantial variation, except for Monday's somewhat elevated price level. Generally speaking, the week will be affordable for electricity users, although the occasional risk of price spikes on Wednesday and Thursday should be considered when planning electricity consumption.
