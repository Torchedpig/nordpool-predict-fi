The electricity price forecast for the coming week looks very volatile. Prices will fluctuate from high figures to even negative ones.

On **Wednesday**, the average price of electricity on the exchange will climb very high, to 18.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. The highest price of the day could rise as high as 29.3 cents. Wednesday's high price is explained by very low wind power production, which will fall to a low of just 110 megawatts during the day. Wind power will only be available at an average of 428 MW on Wednesday. As the weather is also cool, -4.3 degrees, electricity consumption is also high. Electricity is likely to be most expensive in the early evening, around 6-8 PM.

On **Thursday**, the average price of electricity will fall slightly, to 14.7 cents. Wind power will still be scarce, averaging 488 MW. However, there is a high risk of price spikes on Thursday, up to 30-60 cents in individual hours, although the predicted maximum price is 19.9 Â¢. The price spikes would most likely occur in the morning, around 7-9 AM.

On **Friday**, the average price will fall significantly lower, to 8.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. Wind power is forecast to increase significantly, to an average of 2003 megawatts. However, price spikes of up to 20-40 cents should be expected on Friday, during individual hours. The most likely time for spikes is in the morning, around 7-9 AM.

On **Saturday**, the average price of electricity will fall below the four-cent mark (3.7 Â¢/kWh). During the day, the price will fall close to zero, to a low of 0.1 cents. There will be plenty of wind power on Saturday, with an average of 3529 megawatts.

On **Sunday**, the average price of electricity will be only 2.2 Â¢/kWh, and the lowest prices of the day could fall as low as -0.1 cents. During Sunday, there will be plenty of wind power, with an average of 3450 megawatts.

Next **Monday**, the price of electricity will continue to fall. The average price will fall to just one cent per kilowatt-hour, and the lowest prices of the day could be as low as -0.7 cents. Wind power will be very abundant, with an average of 4825 megawatts. Next **Tuesday**, the average price of electricity will rise slightly, to 2.3 cents, but will remain low.
