The price of electricity will vary considerably during the coming week. The cheapest days will be **Thursday** and **Saturday**, when the average price of electricity will remain below three cents per kilowatt-hour. During Thursday and Saturday, the price of electricity will even fall close to zero or below. On Saturday, there will be plenty of wind power available.

On **Friday**, the price of electricity will rise higher. The average price will be around six cents, but there may be large variations in the prices of individual hours. On Friday, there is a risk that the prices of individual hours could rise up to 20 cents. The higher prices on Friday are explained by low wind power, as wind power production will fall below 800 megawatts at times during the day.

On **Sunday**, the price will rise again, and the average price will be over seven cents. On Sunday, there is also a risk that the prices of individual hours could rise up to 20 cents.

At the beginning of next week, the price of electricity will become even more expensive. Next **Monday**, the average price will rise close to ten cents, and the risk of price spikes is high: the prices of individual hours could rise up to 20-40 cents.

Next **Tuesday**, the average price will rise close to twelve cents per kilowatt-hour. Tuesday will be the most expensive day of the week. On Tuesday, the risk of price spikes is particularly high, and the prices of individual hours could rise up to 30-50 cents. The high prices are partly explained by low wind power production, which will remain below 1500 megawatts for most of the day.

Next **Wednesday**, electricity will also be expensive. The average price will be around ten cents, and on Wednesday there is also a high risk that the prices of individual hours could rise up to 20-40 cents.
