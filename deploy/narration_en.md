*Electricity prices will fluctuate significantly towards the end of the week: Thursday and Friday will see high prices and spikes due to weak wind power, while prices will dip negative over the weekend thanks to strong wind energy production.*

Forecast updated on Tuesday at 21:00.

Finland currently has ongoing nuclear power maintenance. The maintenance outage at Olkiluoto 3 started on 1.3.2025 at 03:00 and is estimated to end on 2.5.2025 at 02:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as training data during maintenance periods is limited.

The electricity price forecast for the coming days shows substantial volatility. The highest prices will occur on **Thursday**, with an average price rising to 9.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. Prices on Thursday will vary significantly: they will be at their lowest at around 3.4 cents during the night between 00:00‚Äì02:00, while the highest price of 16.8 cents is anticipated in the evening hours between 18:00‚Äì20:00. Additionally, Thursday has a high risk of price spikes, with electricity prices potentially rising to even 20‚Äì40 cents during single hours. This is mainly due to weak wind power production, which will drop to a minimum of just 381 megawatts during the day.

The price forecast for **Friday** is also higher than usual, with an average price of 7.9 cents. On Friday, prices will fluctuate strongly: during the quiet nighttime hours, prices will drop to 0.6 cents, but reach a peak of 14.8 cents between 08:00‚Äì10:00 in the morning. Friday also carries a high risk of price spikes, during which actual electricity prices may rise as high as 20‚Äì30 cents during certain individual hours. This is again mainly due to low wind power minimum production, which drops down to 349 megawatts.

The cheapest days of the week will be **Saturday** and **Sunday**. Saturday's average price will be under one cent, around 0.9 cents, and Sunday's expected average price will be even lower at 0.1 cents. On both days, negative electricity prices will also be observed during the night and afternoon periods, meaning electricity generation clearly exceeds demand. On Saturday, prices will remain under 3 cents throughout the day, and on Sunday they will reach negative values down to -1.3 cents.

At the beginning of next week, prices will remain moderate. On **Monday**, the average price will rise slightly, but still stay below two cents. Tuesday‚Äôs average price will also be very affordable, around 0.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. Negative prices will again occur on Tuesday, dipping as low as -1.6 cents during the day between 14:00‚Äì16:00.

During the week, weather conditions will remain at normal winter levels, and temperature will not significantly affect electricity prices. The primary reason for price fluctuations is the significant variability in wind power generation, especially evident on Thursday and Friday as a risk of price spikes.
