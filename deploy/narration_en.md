Electricity price expectations will vary during the coming week. On Wednesday and Thursday, prices will remain fairly stable, with an average price of around 7.4 ¢/kWh (**Wednesday**) and 7.3 ¢/kWh (**Thursday**). A similar average price of 7.3 ¢/kWh is expected for Friday.

The price of electricity will fall slightly over the weekend. The average price for **Saturday** is forecast to be 6.0 ¢/kWh and for **Sunday** 5.9 ¢/kWh. On Saturday and Sunday, wind power will be abundant, which partly explains the drop in prices. The coldest temperatures of the week will be during the weekend, with average temperatures falling to -7.6 degrees on Saturday and -8.8 degrees on Sunday.

Next **Monday**, the price of electricity will rise significantly, with an average price of 11.1 ¢/kWh forecast for the day. Monday is also expected to see the highest price peak, up to 30-40 ¢/kWh for individual hours, most likely between 5 PM and 7 PM. This is partly due to the fact that wind power production will drop significantly on Monday, with a minimum of only 842 MW of wind power available. The cold average temperature of -8.0 degrees also contributes to the increase in the price of electricity.

Next **Tuesday**, the price will remain high, with an average price of 10.9 ¢/kWh. Higher-than-usual peak prices are also expected on Tuesday, up to 30 ¢/kWh, although the intraday price difference is forecast to be smaller than on Monday. The individually expensive hours on Tuesday are likely to be between eight and ten in the morning.

Electricity will be at its cheapest on Wednesday night, when the price will temporarily fall below one cent per kilowatt-hour.
