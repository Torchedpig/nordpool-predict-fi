The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage. The outage began on March 1, 2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on May 2, 2025 at 02:00. The maintenance outage may affect forecast accuracy, as training data available during such outages is limited.

Electricity prices will show significant variations in the coming days. The week will begin at very affordable price levels, but prices will rise notably at certain times as the week progresses.

On **Monday**, the average electricity price will remain very low, around half a cent per kilowatt-hour. The highest prices on Monday will occur between 20:00–22:00, yet even these prices will remain moderate, around 1.5 cents.

On **Tuesday**, prices will rise significantly compared to Monday, with an average daily price reaching 4.7 cents. Strong price increases will occur in the morning and evening hours. The day's highest forecasted price, 14.3 ¢, will occur late evening between 19:00–21:00. Negative prices will also appear early Tuesday morning between 02:00–03:00, dropping to -0.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. Additionally, there will be a risk of price spikes on Tuesday, with individual hourly prices potentially surging beyond 20 ¢.

Prices on **Wednesday** and **Thursday** will also remain elevated. On Wednesday, the average daily price will be slightly below four cents, and on Thursday, around six cents. On both days, the highest prices will occur in the morning hours; on Wednesday between approximately 09:00–11:00 and on Thursday around 09:00–11:00. On Thursday, individual hourly prices might spike to as high as 20 cents.

**Friday** will be a public holiday, potentially resulting in lower demand for energy. This is reflected in the forecast, as Friday's average price will remain below three cents. However, even on Friday, there will be a slight risk of individual hourly price spikes, potentially reaching as high as 10 cents.

Weekend prices will again be very affordable. On **Saturday**, average prices will be below two cents, and on Sunday only 0.3 cents. Negative prices will also be observed on both days, particularly on Sunday, when prices will fall to as low as -2.0 cents per kilowatt-hour during the afternoon between 13:00–15:00.
