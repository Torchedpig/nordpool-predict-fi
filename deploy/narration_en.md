Currently, a maintenance outage at Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is ongoing in Finland. The outage started on 1 March 2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on 2 May 2025 at 02:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as training data during outages is limited.

Electricity exchange prices will vary notably during the next few days. The cheapest days of the week will be **Friday** and **Saturday**, when the average electricity price will remain around half a cent. On both days, prices will drop below zero at night, reaching as low as -1.8 cents on Saturday. This will be due to strong winds, causing abundant wind power production, which will lower prices especially during nighttime.

The most expensive day of the week will be **Thursday**, when the average electricity price will rise to approximately five cents per kilowatt-hour. On Thursday morning from 9:00 to 11:00, the price will exceed ten cents, peaking at around 10.7 ¢ near 10:00. However, Thursday carries a high risk of price spikes, so individual hourly prices may rise even higher, possibly reaching 10-20 cents. This will partly result from low wind power production, which will dip to a minimum of just around 531 megawatts during the morning hours.

On **Sunday**, **Monday**, and **Tuesday**, an elevated risk of hourly price spikes has also been identified. On these days, electricity prices could momentarily climb up to ten cents. Particularly on **Tuesday** morning between 9:00 and 11:00, the price is forecasted to approach eight cents, and actual spikes could exceed this level.

The price level on **Wednesday** will be quite moderate, with the day’s average around 1.6 cents. However, in the evening between 17:00 and 19:00, the price will briefly rise above five cents, marking the highest price period of the day. Wednesday's wind power production will fluctuate significantly, partly explaining the price variation.

Public holidays on **Friday**, **Sunday**, and **Monday** may reduce electricity demand, thus contributing to lower prices. Despite this, the risk of price spikes on Sunday and Monday will remain elevated, something worth considering when planning electricity usage.
