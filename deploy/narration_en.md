The upcoming week's electricity price forecast shows clear variation. **Monday** will stand out clearly from other days with a higher average price of about 4.6 ¬¢/kWh. Within the day, price fluctuations will be significant: nighttime hours will be inexpensive, but around 8:00 in the morning, prices will rise above 13 cents. The risk of price spikes will also be notable between 7:00 and 9:00 in the morning, when electricity prices may rise above the forecasted levels. Monday's price increases are explained by exceptionally low minimum wind power production, only 367 MW.

Starting from **Tuesday**, electricity prices will stabilize significantly. Tuesday's average price is below one cent, and negative electricity prices will occur during the night and late afternoon hours. At its highest, the price remains moderate at 2.8 cents around 8:00‚Äì9:00 in the morning. The risk of price spikes on Tuesday is small, but occasional short rises may still occur in the morning hours.

On **Wednesday**, the average electricity price will remain moderate at 1.7 cents. The day's highest prices, around 4.6 cents, will be seen at 8:00 in the morning. Towards the end of the week, on **Thursday** and **Friday**, electricity prices will decrease further. Both days will feature negative minimum prices, and the highest price levels on both days will remain below two cents. Thursday‚Äôs average price will be 0.6 cents and Friday‚Äôs 0.5 cents, making these days the cheapest of the week.

On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, electricity prices will remain low, averaging around 0.7 cents. Both days will see negative price periods in the afternoon, with Sunday reaching as low as -1.6 cents. However, on Sunday, the risk of individual price spikes should be noted, particularly during early morning and late evening hours.

Overall, the week will start with higher prices and conclude with very affordable days. Monday morning hours between 7:00 and 9:00 will be the most expensive times of the week, while Thursday and Friday afternoons will offer the cheapest electricity hours. In the latter half of the week, price levels will remain extremely low, even negative, offering consumers affordable opportunities to use electricity.
