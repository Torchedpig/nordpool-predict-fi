Exchange electricity price expectations will vary in the coming week. The most expensive electricity will be next Wednesday, when the average daily price is forecast to be 11.0 ¢/kWh. Wednesday's maximum price will rise to 17.6 cents per kilowatt-hour, but during individual hours the price of electricity may rise to as much as 30-40 cents.

The risk of a price spike is highest in the afternoon and evening, around 5-7 PM. On Wednesday, wind power will be scarce, with an average of only 1663 MW. The day's lowest wind power production, 1038 MW, will be in the evening. The cold weather, -9.2 degrees, will also increase the price of electricity.

**Monday** is expected to have the second highest average price, 10.0 ¢/kWh. Monday's highest price, 17.0 ¢, will be in the evening between 5 PM and 7 PM. At that time, the prices of individual hours can rise to as much as 20-40 cents. The risk of a price spike on Monday is partly explained by the rather low wind power production, 2156 MW, in the early evening.

On other days, the price of electricity will settle at a more moderate level. Price expectations for **Thursday**, **Friday**, **Saturday** and **Tuesday** are similar, with average prices ranging from 6.3 cents to 8.0 cents.

The cheapest electricity of the week will be available on **Sunday**, when the average price is forecast to be 5.6 ¢/kWh. During Sunday, the price of electricity will fall to a low of 2.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. At that time, wind power will be abundant, with an average of 3814 MW.
