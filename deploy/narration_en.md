Electricity market prices will show significant variation during the upcoming week. The beginning of the week will be very affordable, but prices will clearly rise towards the end of the forecast period.

On **Wednesday** and **Friday**, average electricity prices will linger close to zero, with Friday's prices even slightly negative (-0.1¢). This means that consumers may benefit from negative electricity prices, especially at night. The cheapest hours will occur in the early hours of Wednesday between 01:00–03:00 (-0.3¢) and Friday afternoon between 14:00–16:00 (-1.1¢).

On **Thursday** and **Saturday**, prices will rise slightly but remain below two cents per kilowatt-hour on average. On Saturday, the highest prices will occur in the afternoon between 13:00–15:00 (4.9¢), but this will not significantly increase the day's average price, as night and morning hours remain affordable.

Early next week, prices will increase notably. On **Monday**, the average price will rise above five cents, with the highest levels appearing in the evening hours between 20:00–22:00, when prices exceed ten cents (10.6¢). Clearly, the most expensive day of the week will be **Tuesday**, when the average electricity price climbs to 8.6 cents. Additionally, there is a risk of price spikes on Tuesday, potentially reaching as high as 20 cents during individual hours. The highest forecasted price (14.6¢) is expected in the morning between 07:00–09:00. Tuesday’s high prices will be explained by low wind power production, averaging below 2000 megawatts throughout the day.

Given the significant price fluctuations during the week, timing electricity usage can be important for consumers. Tuesday morning's hours should particularly be noted due to elevated price levels.
