The exchange electricity price forecast for the coming week looks quite variable. Prices will mainly be at affordable levels, but the week will also include more expensive days.

On **Thursday**, the average price of exchange electricity will rise to a very expensive 15 cents per kilowatt-hour. The highest price of the day, 20.4 ¢, will be between 8-10 am. However, the risk of price spikes is high, and prices for individual hours could rise as high as 30-60 cents. This is due to very low wind power production, which is at its lowest at only 95 MW.

On **Friday**, the average price of exchange electricity will settle at 9.6 cents, which is already significantly cheaper, but still expensive. Friday's maximum price will rise to 15.8 cents in the morning between 8-10 am. Wind power production will increase from Thursday, but production will still remain at a low level. A high risk of price spikes, up to 20-40 cents, is also predicted for Friday.

On **Saturday**, the price of exchange electricity will fall. The average price is forecast to be only 2.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Saturday, there will be plenty of wind power available, which explains the low price level.

On **Sunday**, **Monday**, next **Tuesday** and next **Wednesday**, average prices for exchange electricity are expected to remain affordable, below four cents. According to Sunday's forecast, the cheapest hour of the day will be at 4 am, when the price will fall to only 0.1 cents. On the night before Wednesday, the hourly price may even drop to 0.1 cents.
