Electricity prices during the coming days will vary significantly. According to price expectations, the most expensive days of the week will be **Sunday** and **Monday**, when the average electricity price rises above seven cents. On **Sunday**, the price will range from 5.3 to 11.1 cents per kilowatt-hour, with the highest prices occurring particularly in the morning between 8‚Äì10 AM. The weak wind power production, averaging only 929 MW, contributes to Sunday's elevated price level. At its lowest, wind power generation is just 554 MW, explaining Sunday's high maximum price. Additionally, there's a risk of price spikes up to 20 cents per kilowatt-hour during individual hours on Sunday.

On **Monday**, electricity price fluctuations will also be substantial. Although the day's average price is slightly lower than Sunday's (7.0 cents), Monday's maximum price will reach 15.3 cents between 8‚Äì10 AM. Wind power production will vary greatly on Monday: minimum generation of 1149 MW and maximum exceeding 5000 MW. The low minimum wind power production partly accounts for the high maximum price. There is also a significant risk of price spikes on Monday, with individual hourly prices potentially rising as high as 20‚Äì30 cents.

The week's most affordable days will be **Wednesday** and **Friday**, when the average electricity price remains below one cent, dipping even into negative figures. On **Wednesday**, the day's lowest price will be -0.6 cents, and on Friday it will be even lower, at -1.4 cents. Strong wind power production, over 5000 MW on Wednesday and approximately 4000 MW on Friday, drives the price forecast down considerably.

Prices will also remain moderate on **Tuesday** and **Thursday**. Tuesday's average price is 3.0 cents and Thursday's is 3.7 cents. Wind power production on these days will be strong, keeping prices at a low level.

The week's price variations illustrate that electricity prices can fluctuate considerably even over short periods, especially according to wind power generation. Consumers should closely monitor price developments especially on Sunday and Monday, when prices for individual hours could significantly exceed forecasts.
