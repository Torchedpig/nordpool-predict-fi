The price of exchange electricity will be variable next week. At the beginning of the week, the price of electricity will remain low, but towards the end of the week, the price will rise.

On **Tuesday**, the average price of exchange electricity is expected to settle at 1.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. At night, the price will even fall below zero, at its lowest -1.3 cents. On Wednesday, the average price will fall further, to only 0.6 ¢/kWh. Also on **Wednesday**, during the night hours, electricity will be very cheap, even -1.4 ¢/kWh.

**Thursday's** average price will be slightly higher, 1.7 ¢/kWh, but the price will still remain affordable. The cheapest price at night will be -0.1 ¢. On **Friday**, the price will start to rise, and the average price is predicted to be 5.0 ¢/kWh. Friday's highest price, 11.4 ¢, will be around 6 pm.

During the weekend, the price will continue to rise. On **Saturday**, the average price will be 2.9 ¢ and on **Sunday** already 6.3 ¢. On Sunday, there is a risk of price spikes, when the prices of individual hours can rise up to 20 cents. Especially in the evening, between 7 pm and 9 pm, high prices should be expected. On Sunday, less wind power than usual will be available, which partly explains the rise in prices.

Next **Monday**, the average price of exchange electricity will rise to 8.2 cents. Monday's highest price, 11.8 ¢, will be in the morning around 8 am. Wind power production will remain at a low level on Monday, which is one reason for the higher price level. In addition, it will be chilly on Monday, as the average temperature will fall below zero, to -1.2 degrees.
