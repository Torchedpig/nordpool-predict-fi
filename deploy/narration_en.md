*Electricity prices will fluctuate significantly in the upcoming week: early-week prices rise sharply, reaching over 20 cents during individual hours, while towards the end of the week, prices drop close to zero and occasionally even negative as wind power generation increases.*

Olkiluoto 1 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The maintenance started on 11.5.2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 22.5.2025 at 18:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data from maintenance periods is limited.

Significant differences in electricity prices are expected between the days of the upcoming week. Early in the week prices will be notably higher than later in the week, with large fluctuations particularly on **Monday** and **Tuesday**. Monday's average price will be as high as 9.4 cents per kilowatt-hour, and during some individual hours the price is expected to exceed 20 cents. The risk of price spikes is high on Monday morning between approximately 8:00 and 10:00, where the forecasted price rises above 21 cents.

On Tuesday, electricity prices will remain high at times as well. The average price is expected to be around 4.9 cents, with the most expensive hours occurring in the morning between 9:00 and 11:00, where prices will range from about 10 to 13 cents. The risk of price spikes is clear on Tuesday, especially during morning hours.

From mid-week onwards, electricity prices will drop considerably, becoming much cheaper. On Wednesday and Thursday, average prices will remain around one cent. On these days, electricity prices may even turn negative during certain hours. For example, on **Thursday** afternoon between 14:00 and 16:00, negative prices appear in the forecast, reaching as low as -0.9 cents per kilowatt-hour.

From Friday through Sunday, prices will remain low, with daily averages below two cents each day. Friday's average price will be the lowest of the week, approximately 0.7 cents per kilowatt-hour, and during nighttime hours prices may become negative, dropping as low as -0.6 cents.

Over the weekend, electricity prices will remain stable and affordable. However, on Sunday morning between approximately 8:00 and 10:00, there is a small risk of brief price spikes when prices momentarily rise above six cents.

The significant price differences observed throughout the week can partly be explained by fluctuations in wind power generation. At the beginning of the week, wind power availability will be considerably lower, contributing to higher prices on Monday and Tuesday. Later in the week, increased wind power generation will significantly lower the price level.
