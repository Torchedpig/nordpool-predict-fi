The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The outage began on 1.3.2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on 2.5.2025 at 02:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as limited training data is available from periods of maintenance outages.

Next week's electricity spot price development will be variable. Price expectations indicate clear differences between days. **Monday** stands out as the most expensive day of the week. Its average price will be 9.0 cents, and the highest price could rise close to 16 cents between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. Additionally, Monday has a high risk of price spikes, during which individual hourly prices may surge as high as 20‚Äì40 cents per kilowatt-hour.

Prices on **Sunday** and **Friday** will be moderate. Sunday's prices will range from 4.6 to 11.1 cents, with an average of 6.5 cents. Sunday also carries a minor risk of price spikes, which could momentarily elevate electricity prices to around 20 cents. On Friday, the average price will settle at 6.2 cents, with a forecasted maximum of 12.7 cents. Even on Friday, individual hours could peak at approximately 20 cents.

The week's most affordable days will be **Wednesday** and **Saturday**. On Wednesday, the average electricity price will be just 0.2 cents, and prices could even drop below zero during nighttime and early morning hours. Saturday will also experience negative prices, with the day's minimum price at -1.7 cents. Saturday‚Äôs average price is forecasted at 2.3 cents.

On Tuesday and Thursday, prices will remain moderate. Tuesday's average price will be slightly above four cents, while Thursday's average will be around 3.6 cents. On these days, there is no risk of price spikes, and the highest prices will remain below ten cents.

The low prices on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday are partly due to strong wind power production. On Wednesday, wind power production will remain above 4600 megawatts throughout the day, and on Tuesday, average production will exceed 3300 megawatts. Conversely, on Monday and Friday, limited wind power partly explains the higher prices.
