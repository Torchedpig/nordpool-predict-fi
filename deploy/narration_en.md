The exchange electricity price forecast for the coming week looks mostly affordable. Only next **Monday** will the price rise higher than other days. The average price for Monday is expected to be 3.6 ¬¢, and the highest price of the day may rise to 10.1 cents per kilowatt-hour.

The higher prices on Monday are partly explained by the fact that wind power is predicted to be at a lower level than other days. Monday's wind power production is predicted to remain at a minimum of only 2039 megawatts.

On other days, the price of electricity will remain fairly stable and affordable. On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, the average price is predicted to be 1.1 ¬¢/kWh. Also on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, the average price will be close to one cent per kilowatt-hour. The average price for next week's Friday is slightly higher, 1.9 ¬¢.

Negative hourly prices are also expected during the week. On Saturday afternoon and early evening, the price is expected to fall below zero for a few hours. On Sunday, negative prices are expected during the early morning and morning hours. Also on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, occasional negative hourly prices are expected.

Although Monday's maximum price will be higher than other days, the risk of price spikes is not considered high on any day. The prices of individual hours may vary, but large fluctuations are not expected.
