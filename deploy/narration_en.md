Electricity prices will vary notably during the upcoming week. Prices will be higher at the beginning of the week, while significantly more affordable days appear toward the end of the week.

The week's highest price peak will occur on **Monday**, when electricity prices may rise close to 23 cents per kilowatt-hour in the evening between 8 PM and 10 PM. According to the current forecast, Monday's average price will settle slightly above six cents. On **Wednesday**, electricity will also be relatively expensive, about five cents per kilowatt-hour on average, and prices could momentarily climb to 11,5 cents in the morning between 7 AM and 9 AM. Prices on Tuesday will remain more moderate, but brief price spikes of up to 10 cents per kilowatt-hour may still occur during individual hours.

Thursday is a public holiday, which could reduce electricity demand and consequently lower price levels. On this day, the average price will remain below one cent per kilowatt-hour, and negative prices—as low as minus one cent—will occur during nighttime hours.

Heading into the weekend, prices will decrease further. **Friday** and **Saturday** will offer very affordable electricity, with average daily prices below one cent. On **Friday**, prices will even turn negative in the afternoon between 1 PM and 3 PM, reaching as low as -0,5 cents. Negative prices will also appear on **Saturday** and **Sunday**, with Sunday's lowest price dipping as far as -1,5 cents in the early hours between 1 AM and 3 AM.

Overall, the weekend will be exceptionally affordable for electricity users. Price fluctuations will remain moderate, and hourly prices are not expected to rise significantly during those days. Generally, the latter half of the week will offer numerous hours of affordable electricity, as reflected in the low daily averages.
