Electricity prices will vary considerably during the coming week. Electricity will be cheapest over the weekend, especially on **Saturday**, when the average price will drop into negative territory, around -0.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. Sunday's average price will also remain negative (-0.3 Â¢). The lowest hourly prices will occur at night and in the morning on Saturday and Sunday, even reaching approximately -1.2 cents.

The most expensive days of the week will be **Thursday**, **Wednesday**, and **Friday**. On Thursday, the average electricity price will rise to 11.9 cents, with the highest hourly prices occurring in the evening around 6-8 pm, when prices could exceed 20 cents. The forecast also notes an increased risk of price spikes on Thursday, meaning actual prices during certain hours might reach as high as 30â€“50 cents.

Prices on Wednesday and Friday will also rise significantly. Wednesday's average price will be 8.8 cents, with peak prices occurring in the morning between 7-9 am, exceeding 14 cents. Wednesday will also have an elevated risk of price spikes, potentially pushing prices to 20â€“40 cents at individual hours. Fridayâ€™s average price will be slightly lower (8.7 cents), but the highest prices will appear in the morning around 7-9 am, surpassing 16 cents. Friday also carries a high risk of temporary price spikes (20â€“40 cents).

Significant price fluctuations will be strongly influenced by wind power production. On Saturday and Sunday, abundant wind power will markedly lower electricity prices. On Saturday, average wind power production will exceed 5500 MW. In contrast, wind power production on Wednesday and Thursday will remain clearly below 2500 MW, partly explaining the higher prices and the elevated risk of price spikes on these days.

Early in the week, on Monday and Tuesday, average electricity prices will remain moderate, below two cents. Prices on both days will fluctuate slightly from negative figures to just over three or four cents.
