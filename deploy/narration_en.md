The outlook for spot electricity prices remains moderate for the upcoming week, with no exceptionally high average daily prices expected. According to the forecast, Sunday will be the most affordable day of the week, with the average price dropping to 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour and the lowest hourly price even turning negative during the early afternoon between 15:00 and 17:00. Sunday is a public holiday, which typically leads to reduced electricity consumption and supports lower price expectations.

The start of the week, Monday and Tuesday, is projected to be comparatively inexpensive, with average daily prices staying below three cents. Hourly prices during these days fluctuate widely, but the highest prices do not exceed the 5.5 cent level. Both days are also forecast to carry a risk of significant price spikes during individual hours, when the price may momentarily rise to as much as 10 cents, for example during the evening peak between 20:00 and 22:00.

On Wednesday and Thursday, the price level is expected to rise somewhat. Thursday stands out as the most expensive day of the week, with the average price reaching four cents and the daily maximum price peaking at 7.4 cents between 09:00 and 11:00. Wind power production will remain clearly lower throughout Thursday compared to the start of the week, explaining the higher peak price. On Friday, the price level remains elevated, with the average daily price at 3.8 cents and the maximum price reaching 6.5 cents during the morning hours between 08:00 and 11:00. These days also come with a risk of price spikes, which could push hourly prices higher than forecast.

As the weekend approaches, the price level drops noticeably. On Saturday, the average price falls below three cents, and even the highest hourly prices do not exceed 4.2 cents. On Sunday, the electricity price remains low throughout the day, with the lowest hourly price of the week expected in the afternoon, possibly dipping below zero. The public holiday status of Sunday, combined with reasonably consistent wind power production, supports the expected price decrease.

Wind power production will stay mostly at a low level throughout the week, especially from Thursday to Friday. As a result, these days will also see the highest peak prices of the week. The risk of price spikes during individual hours is highlighted for each day, and these spikes may occur especially during morning and evening demand peaks.
