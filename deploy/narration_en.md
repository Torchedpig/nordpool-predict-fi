*Electricity prices in the exchange will fluctuate exceptionally during the upcoming week: early in the week, prices will be high due to weak wind power production, while later in the week prices will drop to negative levels thanks to abundant wind generation.*

The maintenance outage continues at the Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant, which began on 1 March 2025 at 03:00 and is estimated to end on 2 May 2025 at 02:00. This outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as historical data during similar outages is limited.

Forecast updated on Sunday at 21:00.

Electricity prices in the exchange will fluctuate exceptionally in the coming days. The week will start at a higher price level, while towards the end of the week, prices will clearly decrease.

The highest prices will occur on **Monday**, when the average daily price will rise close to 15 cents. In the morning, between 8:00 and 10:00, electricity prices will peak at about 25â€“33 cents per kilowatt-hour. The exceptionally high price will be explained by very weak wind power production, dropping as low as 120 megawatts.

On **Tuesday**, the average price will decrease somewhat, but the risk of price spikes will remain. Although the day's average price is around 10 cents, hourly prices could momentarily rise up to 30 cents. According to the forecast, the most expensive hours will occur in the morning between 9:00 and 11:00, when the wind power production will also be at its lowest, around 500 megawatts.

From **Wednesday** onwards, prices will drop significantly. The average price will be less than five cents, and there will be no risk of price spikes. On **Thursday**, prices will decrease further, and the average electricity price will fall below three cents. The cheapest hours of the day will occur in the afternoon between 13:00 and 15:00, when the price will be only 0.1 cents per kilowatt-hour.

On **Friday**, electricity prices will even become negative during the early morning hours between 2:00 and 4:00. The daily average price will remain very affordable, only 0.4 cents per kilowatt-hour.

Over the weekend, the exceptional price development will continue. On **Saturday**, the average electricity price will be unusually low, at -1 cent per kilowatt-hour. During the day, electricity prices will drop as low as -2.8 cents, especially between 12:00 and 18:00.
