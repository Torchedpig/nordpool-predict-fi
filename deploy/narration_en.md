*The price of electricity on the power exchange fluctuates dramatically: on Friday the price will rise significantly, but on the weekend and next week price expectations are very moderate, and electricity will even be free at times. Olkiluoto nuclear power plant is undergoing a long maintenance outage.*

Olkiluoto 3's maintenance outage began on March 1, 2025, at 03:00 and is estimated to end on May 2, 2025, at 02:00. Because there is limited teaching data available for the period of maintenance outages, the outage may affect the accuracy of the forecast.

The forecast has been updated on Thursday at 21:00.

The electricity price forecast for the coming week shows a rather variable picture. On **Friday**, the price will rise significantly higher than on other days. The average price on Friday will be 11.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, and the highest price of the day will rise to 17.7 cents. Friday's price peak is expected to occur in the evening, between approximately 6 and 8 PM. The price is pushed up especially by the low amount of wind power during the day: on Friday, wind power will only be available between 418-4615 MW, with an average of 1795 MW.

On other days, the price of electricity will be significantly cheaper. During the period from Saturday to Thursday, the average price of electricity will remain below three cents, and on most days even below two cents. For example, on **Sunday**, the average price is expected to be only 0.6 ¬¢/kWh, and the lowest prices of the day will even fall below zero.

During the weekend and next week, wind power is expected to be abundant, which will push prices down. For example, on **Saturday**, wind power will be available up to 3755-6253 MW, with an average of 5498 MW. Also on **Monday**, **Tuesday**, **Wednesday** and next **Thursday**, wind power production will remain at a high level.

During the weekend and next week, the price of electricity will fall at times below zero during the nights and mornings, while during the days and evenings the price will rise slightly higher. In general, however, price expectations are very moderate, and no major price spikes are in sight after Friday.
