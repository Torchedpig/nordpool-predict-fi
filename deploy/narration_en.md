The price of exchange electricity will increase in the coming week. Price expectations will be at their highest next Thursday, when the average daily price is forecast to be 13.0 ¢/kWh. Thursday's maximum price could rise to 19.7 cents per kilowatt-hour.

On **Monday**, **Wednesday**, and Thursday, there is a high risk of price spikes. Prices for individual hours could rise as high as 30-50 cents per kilowatt-hour. The risk of price spikes is greatest on Thursday morning between 7-9 AM and in the evening between 5-7 PM. For Wednesday, the possibility of price spikes is concentrated in the evening. As for Monday the highest hourly prices will occur in the early evening from 5-7 PM.

On **Sunday**, there is also a risk of price spikes. The prices of individual hours can rise up to 20-30 cents per kilowatt-hour. Sunday is the only public holiday of the week, when electricity consumption is typically lower than on weekdays, but Sunday's increased price risk is due to the predicted low wind power.

Next week's price fluctuations will be largely explained by variations in wind power production and low temperatures. Especially on Thursday, wind power is predicted to be very low, which will increase the price of electricity. The average temperatures on Wednesday and Thursday will drop well below freezing, to around -9 degrees Celsius.

The cheapest electricity of the week will be available on **Friday**, when the average daily price will remain at 5.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. Friday's cheap hours will be in the early evening and evening.
