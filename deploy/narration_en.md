Electricity price expectations for the upcoming week will remain mostly affordable. However, there will be noticeable differences between days, and individual hours may see significantly higher prices than the overall daily averages.

The most notable exception of the week will be **Monday**, when the average electricity price will rise to 4,4 cents. The day's most expensive hours will occur in the morning between 8:00 and 10:00, when prices are forecasted to reach 13,8 cents per kilowatt-hour. The elevated peak price is primarily due to very low wind power production, which will drop to a minimum of only 356 megawatts. This represents the week's lowest wind power minimum and partly explains the increase in prices. Monday will have a high risk of price spikes, meaning actual price levels could exceed the forecasted values.

On **Sunday**, price expectations will be negative, with an average price of -0,1 cents. During the day, the electricity price will reach its lowest point at -1,6 cents per kilowatt-hour in the afternoon between 13:00 and 15:00.

On **Tuesday**, the average electricity price will remain very low, at just 0,3 cents. The day's lowest prices will occur in the early morning hours between 4:00 and 6:00. Despite the overall moderate price level, the risk of price spikes remains elevated during individual hours.

Midweek, on **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, prices will remain very low. The average price on Wednesday will be 0,4 cents and exactly one cent on Thursday. No significant price spikes are expected on either day.

On **Friday**, the daily average price will rise to nearly four cents, and the highest price period will occur in the evening between 20:00 and 22:00, reaching 8,6 cents.

During the weekend, on **Saturday**, the average price will decrease again to 1,6 cents. Still, individual price spikes may occur during Saturday, although these will be considerably lower compared to Monday.
