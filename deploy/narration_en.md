*Electricity prices will remain mostly affordable in the coming week, but significant price spikes are expected on Tuesday morning due to low wind power production; Olkiluoto 3's maintenance outage continues, potentially affecting forecast accuracy.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage, which started on March 1, 2025, at 03:00 and is expected to last until May 2, 2025, at 02:00. This outage may affect the accuracy of electricity price forecasts, as training data from periods of maintenance outages are limited.

Forecast updated on Saturday at 12:00.

In the upcoming week, electricity prices will generally remain quite affordable, although noticeable variations will occur between days. Early in the week, average prices will stay around or below three cents per kilowatt-hour, but on **Tuesday**, prices will clearly rise. Tuesday's average price will climb above five cents, and in the morning between 8:00 and 10:00, prices could peak at over 14 cents per kilowatt-hour.

The cheapest hours of the week will mostly occur at night, when prices may even dip into negative territory. For example, during early **Sunday** morning between 4:00 and 6:00, electricity prices may turn negative, and similar instances will occur over the weekend. Negative prices indicate moments when producers effectively pay consumers to use electricity.

**Tuesday's** unusually high maximum price is closely linked to exceptionally low wind power production, which drops as low as 828 MW. This very low wind level in the morning partly explains the elevated price level. Additionally, Tuesday carries a higher-than-usual risk of sudden price spikes, potentially rising up to 20 cents during the morning between 8:00 and 10:00.

On **Wednesday**, **Thursday**, and **Friday**, price levels will be somewhat lower than Tuesday's peak but will still average above four cents. During these days, hourly prices may surpass 10 cents, and there remains a slight risk of sudden price spikes temporarily exceeding ten cents per kilowatt-hour.

Heading towards the weekend, prices will decline again. On **Saturday**, average prices will drop below three cents, and nighttime prices may again become negative. However, Saturday will feature considerable intra-day price fluctuations; the price difference between the cheapest hour at night and the most expensive hour in the morning could be substantial.

Overall, the week's price variability will primarily be driven by fluctuations in wind power generation. Tuesday's particularly low wind generation significantly increases the day's electricity price level. On other days, wind power production will be closer to normal levels, exerting no significant impact on prices.
