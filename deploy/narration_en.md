*Electricity exchange prices will remain mostly affordable in the coming days, but prices will rise significantly on Sunday and Monday due to low wind power generation; the ongoing maintenance outage at Olkiluoto 3 may affect forecast accuracy.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is undergoing a maintenance outage. The outage began on March 1, 2025, at 03:00 and is expected to end on May 2, 2025, at 02:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as limited training data is available for periods with nuclear plant outages.

Forecast updated on Wednesday at 14:18.

Electricity exchange prices will be generally affordable in the coming days. However, the forecast clearly indicates variability between individual days, allowing price-conscious consumers to take advantage of the most inexpensive hours if desired.

As the week progresses, prices will remain moderate initially. On **Thursday** and **Friday**, the average price will remain under one cent per kilowatt-hour, and **Saturday** will also continue the affordable trend. During these days, negative prices will even occur overnight, especially on **Saturday**, when the lowest price is forecasted at -1.3 cents. This means the market price of electricity will briefly dip into negative.

A significant shift will occur on **Sunday**, when the average price climbs above five cents. The highest hourly price on Sunday will reach 8.6 cents between 19:00 and 21:00. The risk of price spikes is notably elevated on Sunday, and individual hourly prices might rise as high as 20 cents. Low wind power production, averaging only 1532 megawatts on Sunday, explains this price increase.

On **Monday**, the average price will remain similarly elevated at around 5.3 cents. The day's most notable price peak will occur between 09:00 and 11:00, when the price is expected to rise to 13.4 cents. Wind power production on Monday will average only 2090 megawatts, partially explaining the elevated prices. The possibility of price spikes also exists on Monday, with hourly prices potentially rising to 20 cents, similar to Sunday.

On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, prices will moderate again, although Wednesday's average price will rise slightly above six cents. However, there is no significant risk of price spikes anticipated on these days. Towards the end of the week, prices appear to stabilize, but consumers should monitor updates, as changes in wind forecasts may affect final prices.
