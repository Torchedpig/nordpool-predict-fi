The price of electricity on the power exchange will vary during the coming week. The cheapest days will be **Saturday** and **Sunday**, when the average daily price will remain below six cents per kilowatt-hour. On Saturday and Sunday, there will be plenty of wind power available, which will push prices down. On Sunday, the intraday variation is small, and the price of electricity will remain between 3.1 and 8.5 cents throughout the day.

The most expensive day will be **Friday**, when the average price will rise to 13.5 cents. Friday's maximum price will climb to 20.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. There is also a risk on Friday that the prices of individual hours will rise to as much as 30-50 cents. The highest prices will likely be in the evening between 5 PM and 7 PM, when wind power production is lower. Friday's price is also raised by the severe frost: the average daily temperature is -5.6 degrees.

On Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, average prices will settle around 9.7–10.6 cents. However, on **Monday**, high price spikes are expected, even 20-40 cents for individual hours. The price spikes will probably occur in the afternoon and evening between 3 PM and 7 PM. On Tuesday, there is no risk of price spikes, and the price will otherwise remain moderate.

Next **Wednesday** and next **Thursday**, one should also prepare for high price spikes, even 30-40 cents for individual hours. On Wednesday, the spikes will probably occur in the morning between 7 AM and 9 AM and in the evening between 6 PM and 8 PM. On Thursday, price spikes may occur in the morning between 7 AM and 9 AM. The average temperatures on Wednesday and Thursday will fall well below freezing, which partly explains the rise in prices.

During the week, the price of electricity on the power exchange will be at its cheapest on Sunday night between 1 AM and 2 AM, when the price will fall to 3.4 cents per kilowatt-hour.
