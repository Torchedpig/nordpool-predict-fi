The Olkiluoto 1 nuclear power plant is undergoing maintenance, which started on 11.5.2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 21.5.2025 at 22:00. This maintenance outage may influence the accuracy of this price forecast, as training data available from maintenance periods is limited.

During the upcoming week, electricity prices will remain very affordable on average. The daily average prices will mostly stay clearly below two cents. The lowest daily average price will occur next **Monday**, dropping slightly into negative territory at -0.1 cents. On Monday, the hourly price will vary between -0.7 and 0.7 cents.

The highest hourly prices of the week will occur on **Saturday**, peaking at 5.2 cents around 9:00 in the morning. On the same day, wind power production will drop to its lowest point at only 1328 megawatts, partly explaining the higher peak price. Saturday’s intraday price variation will be significant, as prices already turn negative between 14:00–16:00, reaching a minimum of -0.8 cents.

Negative prices will also occur on **Sunday**, when the lowest hourly price will reach -1.8 cents in the afternoon between 14:00–16:00. Sunday's prices will remain very low throughout the day, with the average daily price at just 0.1 cents.

Other days of the week will be stable, without major price fluctuations. On **Thursday** and **Friday**, prices will remain moderate, varying roughly between zero and just under three cents. **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** will see slightly greater variation, but average prices will still remain very low, clearly under one cent.

Overall, electricity prices in the coming week will stay at exceptionally low levels. Although peak prices on Saturday will momentarily exceed five cents, the weekly average price will remain highly affordable.
