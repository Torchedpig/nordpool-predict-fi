The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The outage began on 1 March 2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on 2 May 2025 at 02:00. The maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the forecast due to limited training data available during such outages.

Electricity prices for the upcoming week will vary significantly from day to day. Clearly the cheapest days will be **Friday** and **Wednesday**, with average prices remaining below one cent per kilowatt-hour. Both days will see negative hourly prices. On Friday, the cheapest hours will occur in the early morning between 03:00 and 06:00, dropping nearly a cent below zero. On Wednesday, electricity prices will dip below zero early in the morning and remain very low throughout the day.

On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, prices will rise slightly, but average prices will remain moderate, around four cents. On Saturday, the cheapest hours will be in the early morning, while the most expensive times will be in the evening from 19:00 to 21:00, when prices exceed nine cents.

The clear exception during the week will be **Monday**, when electricity prices are expected to rise significantly. The average price will approach nine cents, and the risk of price spikes is real. During peak hours in the morning from 08:00 to 10:00, prices may rise to levels between 20 and 40 cents. Monday's price spikes are explained by lower wind power generation, with wind energy production dropping to slightly over 1600 megawatts at its lowest point.

On **Tuesday**, prices will return to more moderate levels, averaging under five cents. The highest prices will occur in the late morning hours, briefly rising just above eight cents. After Wednesday, prices will again fluctuate more significantly on **Thursday**. Thursday's highest hourly price between 08:00 and 10:00 will reach 17.5 cents, with a risk of price spikes pushing individual hourly rates up to 20 cents.

The price spikes and notable fluctuations early in the week will be largely due to variability in wind power production. In particular, Monday's low minimum wind generation explains that day's sudden price increase.
