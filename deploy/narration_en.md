*Electricity exchange prices will fluctuate significantly in the coming days: risk of price spikes rises clearly towards the end of the week, electricity will be very affordable over the weekend, and Olkiluoto 3 maintenance outage may affect forecast accuracy.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The outage began on 1.3.2025 at 03:00, and it is expected to end on 2.5.2025 at 02:00. Due to limited training data available during maintenance periods, this outage may affect the accuracy of price forecasts.

Forecast updated on Tuesday at 09:00.
