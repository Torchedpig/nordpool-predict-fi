*Electricity prices on the exchange will remain generally low during the coming week, even dipping into negative territory during the weekend, although isolated higher peaks will occur particularly on Friday and Thursday as wind power generation temporarily declines.*

A maintenance outage is ongoing at the Olkiluoto 1 nuclear power plant, starting on 11.5.2025 at 18:00 and expected to end on 22.5.2025 at 18:00. This outage may affect forecast accuracy, as training data from outage periods is limited.

The forecast was updated on Thursday at 21:06.

Electricity prices in the coming week will generally be low on the power exchange. However, daily differences will be considerable, especially between the weekend and early week. The week's highest average price will occur on **Friday**, averaging 3.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. Notably, a price peak will occur on Friday morning between 7:00–9:00, when prices approach 19 cents per hour. This will partly result from relatively low wind power generation at that time, dropping below 700 megawatts.

On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, prices will clearly decrease, remaining very low or even negative. Saturday's average price will be around half a cent per kilowatt-hour, and Sunday's average will dip slightly negative to -0.3 cents. Wind power generation will be abundant on both days, explaining the low prices.

On **Monday**, price expectations will rise slightly from the weekend, averaging 1.8 cents. During this day, there will be a moderate risk of price spikes, especially in the morning around 8:00–10:00, when prices may rise close to six cents. At that time, wind power generation will temporarily drop to relatively low levels.

Tuesday and Wednesday prices will remain moderate, around one cent, with no significant price spikes expected. Prices will fluctuate from slightly negative to a few cents per kilowatt-hour. On both days, abundant wind power generation will keep prices low.

On Thursday, prices will again rise slightly, averaging 2.3 cents. In particular, in the evening between 20:00–22:00 prices will rise above eight cents. On the same day, wind power generation will temporarily be at its lowest point of the week, contributing to higher prices.

Overall, electricity market prices will appear favorable to consumers in the coming week, although price variations between different days and hours will be noteworthy. In particular, the weekend will offer exceptionally low-cost electricity, whereas individual hours on Friday and Thursday could be significantly more expensive.
