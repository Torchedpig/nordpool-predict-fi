*Electricity prices will remain exceptionally low in the coming days, even turning negative over the weekend, although isolated higher price spikes may occur on Wednesday due to weaker wind power production. Overall, the price level is expected to be very affordable throughout the forecast period.*

Over the coming days, electricity prices will range from low to extremely low. Prices are expected to remain affordable throughout the forecast period.

At the beginning of the period, on **Thursday**, prices will be moderate. The expected average price is 2.1 cents, but during the night and early morning hours, prices will drop close to zero or even slightly negative. Thursday's highest prices will occur right at the start of the day, around midnight, reaching about 11 cents per kilowatt-hour. Thursday's price levels are partly explained by a public holiday, which may reduce electricity consumption compared to normal.

The week's most affordable days will be during the weekend. On **Friday**, an extremely low average price is expected, only 0.1 cents per kilowatt-hour. The lowest price on Friday will be around -1.4 ¬¢ during nighttime hours. Similarly, on **Saturday** and **Sunday**, prices will remain very low, close to zero cents. Saturday's average price will even be slightly negative at -0.2 ¬¢, meaning electricity producers will on average be paying consumers to use electricity during the day. Sunday's average price, like Friday's, is expected to be only 0.1 ¬¢.

From **Monday** onward, prices will rise slightly but remain clearly affordable. Monday's average price will be 2.8 cents, with peak hourly prices around 5.6 cents. However, prices will still fluctuate into negative territory during nighttime hours. On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, average electricity prices will also remain low, with Tuesday's expected average at 1.4 ¬¢ and Wednesday's at 2.7 ¬¢.

The only day with a clear risk of price spikes is **Wednesday**, when hourly prices might occasionally rise up to around ten cents or slightly above. This potential price spike would most likely occur on Wednesday evening between approximately 19:00 and 21:00. The risk of a price spike is increased by a brief drop in wind power production, which will momentarily fall below 1500 megawatts, reducing wind-generated electricity supply precisely during the peak price hours.
