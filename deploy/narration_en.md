Electricity prices are expected to remain affordable in the coming days, with no exceptionally high average prices predicted. This week's price level will generally fluctuate between under three and seven cents. However, there are notable variations between individual days.

The most affordable day this week will be **Wednesday**, when the average electricity price is expected to be around two and a half cents per kilowatt-hour. Wednesday will also feature the week's lowest hourly price, when during the early morning hours (between 3-5 AM), prices will briefly dip below zero, reaching -0.1 cents. Negative prices will also appear on **Sunday** afternoon from 1 to 3 PM, with the lowest hourly price at -1.0 ¢.

The highest prices are expected on **Friday**, when the average electricity price will rise to nearly seven cents. The week's highest hourly price will also occur that day, between 7 and 9 AM, reaching 12.7 cents. Additionally, Friday poses a risk of price spikes, during which individual hourly prices could rise up to 20 cents.

A higher risk of price spikes will continue on **Saturday** as well. Although the expected average price for the day remains moderate at under five cents, prices during certain hours could rise up to ten cents. As the weekend progresses, prices will drop again, with Sunday's average around two and a half cents, and Monday prices remaining affordable.

The variation in electricity prices during the week is partly due to changes in wind power production. Friday's higher price levels and risk of price spikes can be explained by low wind power production, averaging slightly over 2200 megawatts. Saturday's wind power output will be similarly low, also contributing to the potential price spikes.
