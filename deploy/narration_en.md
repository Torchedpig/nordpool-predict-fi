Electricity prices next week are expected to remain mostly affordable, but day-to-day variations will be substantial. The difference between the lowest and highest prices throughout the week will reach nearly 12 cents per kilowatt-hour. Wind power fluctuations clearly influence these price variations.

On **Saturday**, the average electricity price is forecasted to be just 0.3 cents. Throughout the day, electricity will occasionally be priced slightly negatively, especially in the afternoon between 12:00 and 17:00. During these hours, consumers may momentarily benefit from negative prices.

The situation will change significantly on **Sunday**. The average price will rise to around 3.3 cents, with the peak price occurring in the morning hours between 8:00 and 10:00, reaching almost eight cents. This is strongly influenced by very low wind power output, dropping below 300 megawatts in the morning. Sunday's forecast also highlights a risk of price spikes during individual hours.

The week's most affordable days will be **Monday** and **Tuesday**, when prices will remain very close to zero or even negative. On Tuesday, the average price is forecasted to be practically zero cents, and afternoon hours will see prices dipping as low as one cent into negative territory.

On **Thursday**, a public holiday may affect electricity demand and consequently prices. Although the day's average price remains modest (1.3 cents), individual hours could see prices rise as high as four cents. A specific risk of price spikes has been noted for Thursday.

The week's most expensive day will be **Friday**, with an average price approaching five cents per kilowatt-hour. The peak price of the week is forecasted for Friday morning, between 8:00 and 10:00, when electricity prices could surpass 11 cents. This notable price peak clearly ties to reduced wind power output during the morning, below 1500 megawatts.
