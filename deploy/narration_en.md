The price forecast for exchange electricity for the coming week looks mostly affordable, but on **Friday** the price will rise significantly higher. The average price for Friday is expected to be 11.4 ¬¢/kWh, and the highest price of the day may rise to 17.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. Friday's high price is partly explained by the low amount of wind power during the early morning and morning hours. Wind power production is at its lowest at only 460 MW, while towards the evening production rises to over 4000 megawatts. The maximum price for Friday is likely to be in the early evening between 7 PM and 9 PM.

On **Saturday**, the price of exchange electricity will fall very low, and the average price is forecast to be only 1.5 ¬¢/kWh. During the night between Saturday and Sunday, the price may even dip below zero. On Saturday, wind power will be abundant, with an average of 5472 MW.

Also on **Sunday**, the price of electricity will remain low, with an average price of only 1.2 ¬¢/kWh. During the night between Sunday and Monday, and on Sunday afternoon, the price may fall below zero.

Next week, starting from **Monday**, the price of electricity will remain affordable but will rise from the very low figures of the weekend. The average prices for Monday, **Tuesday**, **Wednesday**, and next **Thursday** will vary between 2.3 and 3.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. After the weekend's freezing temperatures, on Tuesday and Wednesday, the average daily temperature will rise above zero.

Throughout the week's observation period, wind power will be quite abundant, and it is not expected to significantly affect the price of electricity between Monday and Thursday.
