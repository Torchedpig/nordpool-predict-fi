The electricity price forecast for the upcoming week shows considerable day-to-day variation. The most expensive day will clearly be **Wednesday**, when the average price will exceed 10 cents. Particularly expensive electricity will be observed in the morning between 8‚Äì10, when prices will rise above 42 ¬¢. The high peak price is connected to extremely low wind power production during the morning hours, dipping as low as 314 megawatts.

On **Thursday**, by contrast, the average electricity price will remain below one cent, and individual hourly prices will even dip into negative territory. The lowest prices will occur in the afternoon, between 14‚Äì16, when electricity will be priced as low as minus one cent per kilowatt-hour. The exceptionally low price is due to abundant wind power production, averaging over 5000 megawatts.

**Friday** and **Saturday** prices will remain affordable, with average prices hovering around 1‚Äì2 cents. Both days will again experience negative prices during nighttime. On Saturday, the cheapest hours will occur in the middle of the day, between 13‚Äì15, when prices will drop 0,4 cents below zero.

On **Sunday**, the average electricity price will rise slightly, but still remain affordable at around three cents. However, there is a forecasted risk of price spikes this day, potentially pushing hourly prices up to around ten cents, especially during evening hours between 19‚Äì21.

On **Monday**, prices will rise significantly. Wind power production will remain low, and the day's average price will exceed eight cents. Particularly expensive hours will occur in the morning between 8‚Äì10, when prices will approach 17 cents. Monday also carries a significant risk of price spikes, with potential prices reaching as high as 20‚Äì30 cents per hour.

Next week's Tuesday and Wednesday will see prices at more moderate levels, although both days still carry some risk of occasional price spikes. On Tuesday, prices could momentarily rise up to 10 cents, while on Wednesday, peak prices might reach up to 20 cents.
