Electricity market prices are expected to vary considerably in the coming days. Particularly noteworthy are high peak prices as well as potential negative minimum prices during nighttime.

The week's highest prices will be seen on **Monday**, when the average price is expected to be 10.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. Monday's forecast maximum price is nearly 17 cents, but according to the risk model, individual hourly peaks could surge as high as 30‚Äì40 cents. The peak price is expected on Monday morning, roughly between 8:00 and 10:00.

On **Wednesday**, electricity prices will also average high, around 9.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. Wednesday's maximum price will be around 16 ¬¢, but there is a risk of even higher price spikes, potentially reaching 20‚Äì40 cents, especially in the morning around 7:00‚Äì9:00. The elevated Wednesday prices are partly explained by low wind power production, dropping as low as 361 MW at certain times.

On **Sunday**, prices are expected to average 6.8 cents, but risk of hourly price spikes rises again. On Sunday evening, roughly between 20:00 and 22:00, electricity prices may reach 20‚Äì30 cents at individual hours.

The cheapest days of the week will be **Thursday**, **Friday**, and **Saturday**, when average prices will remain around one cent per kilowatt-hour. On Thursday and Friday, negative prices are expected during nighttime hours. During these periods, electricity prices will dip below zero, with the lowest prices forecast at -0.6 ¬¢ on Thursday and -0.4 ¬¢ on Friday. This low pricing is partly due to very abundant wind power generation, which remains at high levels during these days.

Next **Tuesday**, electricity prices are forecast to remain stable and moderate, with an average price of 5.7 cents. However, the risk of price spikes persists, and prices may climb to around 20 cents per kilowatt-hour at individual hours.
