*On Tuesday, electricity prices will rise significantly due to weak wind power, with a notable risk of price spikes, but the rest of the week will bring very low and even negative electricity prices.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is undergoing a maintenance outage, which started on 1.3.2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on 2.5.2025 at 02:00. The maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as there is limited training data available from periods with outages.

The electricity market price forecast shows significant variations across the upcoming days. Tuesday will clearly be the most expensive day of the week. The average price of the day will be 10.4 cents per kilowatt-hour, and at its highest, the price is expected to rise to approximately 18.9 cents. There is also a significant risk of price spikes on Tuesday. Prices during single hours could rise as high as 30‚Äì40 cents per kilowatt-hour. The most likely timing for these price spikes will be in the late morning between 9:00 and 11:00, coinciding with the forecasted maximum price.

Tuesday‚Äôs price development is partly explained by low wind power production. The wind power output, at its lowest level only 641 MW, is significantly lower than on other days. This contributes to the price increase during the morning hours.

From Wednesday onward, the situation will become considerably more affordable. Wednesday‚Äôs average price will drop below four cents, and Thursday‚Äôs just slightly above four cents per kilowatt-hour. Price fluctuations on these days will be moderate, and no risk of price spikes is forecasted. Thursday‚Äôs cheapest hour will occur in the afternoon between 16:00 and 18:00, when prices will approach zero (0.1 ¬¢).

On Friday, prices will decline even further, with an average daily price of only 0.1 ¬¢, and the price level will remain extremely low throughout the day. Negative electricity prices will also occur during Friday, dropping as low as -0.9 ¬¢. Negative prices will continue during the weekend as well. On Saturday, the lowest price will reach -1.2 cents, and on Sunday -1.0 cents per kilowatt-hour.

On Monday, electricity prices will rise modestly again but will remain affordable at about 4.5 cents. Price fluctuations during the day will be minor, and exceptionally high prices are not expected.

Thus, the price developments of the week will be characterized by Tuesday‚Äôs high prices and the extremely affordable and even negative price periods towards the end of the week.
