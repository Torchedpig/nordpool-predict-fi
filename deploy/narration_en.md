*Electricity prices will see significant fluctuations in the coming days: early in the week, high price spikes are expected, whereas towards the end of the week, market electricity prices may even turn negatively low, influenced by the Olkiluoto 3 maintenance break.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is undergoing a maintenance break that started on 1 March 2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on 2 May 2025 at 02:00. This maintenance break may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data from maintenance periods is limited.

The forecast was updated on Wednesday at 14:19.

The electricity price forecast for the coming days indicates clear daily differences. In the early part of the week, especially on **Monday**, the average electricity price will be notably higher at around 9.0 cents. On the same day, price levels may momentarily rise to as high as 20‚Äì40 cents per kilowatt-hour, particularly in the morning between approximately 7‚Äì9 and again in the evening from around 17‚Äì19.

Prices will decrease slightly on **Tuesday** compared to Monday but will still remain somewhat elevated, averaging around 6 cents. During the morning, roughly from 8‚Äì10, electricity prices could exceed 10 cents, although the risk of exceptional price spikes is negligible.

Midweek, prices will decline further. On **Wednesday**, the average price will already be affordable, around three cents, and negative prices are also expected overnight and in the early morning hours. Similarly, on **Thursday** and **Friday**, average prices will remain very low, close to zero. On these days, multiple hours with negative electricity prices are expected, particularly in the early morning and early afternoon.

Heading into the weekend, prices on **Saturday** and **Sunday** will continue to be moderate. Saturday's average price will be around two and a half cents, although the week's highest single price, approximately 7.4 cents, will occur in the afternoon between roughly 14‚Äì16. On Sunday, the average price remains moderate, just below two cents.

Wind power production significantly affects the week's electricity price levels. Monday's higher prices are partly explained by the lower-than-average wind generation: wind power minimum will be only around 1600 MW. On other days, wind production is more plentiful, explaining the affordable and even negative prices observed midweek.
