*Electricity prices for the coming week will remain mostly affordable, although Monday will see a significant price spike due to low wind power production. On other days, prices stabilize, with occasional negative pricing especially during night and early morning hours.*

The Olkiluoto 1 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage. The maintenance began on 11 May 2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 22 May 2025 at 18:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as training data during maintenance outages is limited.

The forecast was updated on Saturday at 14:24.

Electricity price expectations for the upcoming week will mostly remain affordable. On average, prices will hover around two cents per kilowatt-hour or below. However, a notable exception will occur on **Monday**, when the day's average price will rise to five cents per kilowatt-hour. Price fluctuations within the day will be extremely pronounced. Monday's highest hourly price is forecasted for the morning hours between 8:00-10:00, potentially climbing as high as 15.5 cents. There is an elevated risk of price spikes during individual hours, meaning actual peak-hour prices could exceed the forecasted levels.

Monday's unusually high price levels can primarily be explained by very low wind power production. At its minimum, wind power output will be only 263 MW, corresponding to nearly calm conditions. This partly accounts for the sharp rise in prices on Monday.

On **Tuesday**, prices will return to lower levels. The day's average price will remain below one cent, and fluctuations will be moderate, although the possibility of individual price spikes still exists. Early Tuesday morning will even witness negative prices, starting from -0.6 cents.

From Wednesday to Saturday, prices will remain stable and low. Average daily prices will range between 0.5 and 1.5 cents. Negative pricing will again appear during early morning hours on Thursday and Friday, reaching as low as -0.6 cents on Friday and -0.3 cents on Thursday. On Saturday afternoon between 13:00-15:00, prices will reach the week's lowest level, dropping down to -1.6 cents.

Overall, the week's price levels will be low, though Monday morning's price peak stands out notably. Actual prices may still deviate from the forecast, especially if wind conditions change.
