The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant will be undergoing maintenance outage from 1 March 2025 at 03:00 until 2 May 2025 at 02:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data during outages is limited.

The coming week's electricity price forecast shows significant variations between days. The weekend begins affordably, as prices on **Saturday** average close to zero, even dipping into negative territory during the day's cheapest hours. On **Sunday**, however, the situation changes considerably, with the average price rising to nearly seven cents per kilowatt-hour. Prices are expected to fluctuate significantly that day, with individual hours potentially spiking to 20â€“30 cents between 19:00â€“21:00 in the evening.

The week's most expensive day will be **Monday**, when the average electricity price climbs above 11 cents per kilowatt-hour. Wind power production will be at a relatively low average level that day, partly explaining the higher prices. Price fluctuations on Monday will also be significant, with price peaks forecasted to reach as high as 30â€“40 cents per kilowatt-hour between 8:00â€“10:00 in the morning.

**Tuesday** and **Wednesday** will be more moderate in terms of pricing. On Tuesday, the average electricity price will remain well below three cents, and Wednesday also will not exceed five cents. These days offer steadier and cheaper electricity without significant price spikes. On Thursday, the price level will drop further, keeping the average electricity price below one cent, even turning negative during the day's cheapest hours.

The week concludes again with very affordable prices. On **Friday**, the average electricity price will hover around half a cent, with prices falling into negative territory during the afternoon. Next **Saturday**, prices will remain consistently slightly above one cent without significant fluctuations throughout the day.

During the week, electricity price variations will be exceptionally large, especially on Sunday and Monday, when hourly prices may rise considerably above the forecasted average. On other days, electricity prices will remain steadier and mostly affordable.
