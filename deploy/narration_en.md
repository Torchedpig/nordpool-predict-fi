*Early-week holidays keep electricity prices moderate, but significant price increases are forecasted for Tuesday and Thursday, with notable hourly price spikes possible as Olkiluoto 3's maintenance outage continues.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage. The outage began on 1 March 2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on 2 May 2025 at 02:00. The maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of this price forecast, as there is limited training data available for periods with nuclear plant outages.

The week's forecast shows considerable variation in electricity prices between days. The price level remains moderate during the early-week holidays. On **Sunday** and **Monday**, daily average prices will stay below three cents per kilowatt-hour, and even the maximum prices will not exceed six and a half cents.

Prices will rise significantly on **Tuesday**, with the daily average forecasted at 7.5 cents. Tuesday's peak price is expected in the evening hours between 18:00 and 20:00, potentially reaching nearly 14 cents. The risk of price spikes is high, and individual hourly prices could rise up to 20â€“30 cents.

On Wednesday, prices will slightly decrease but still remain above five cents on average. The highest price will occur immediately after midnight between 00:00 and 02:00, reaching around ten cents. A risk of price spikes also exists on Wednesday, with prices possibly spiking up to around 20 cents.

The week's highest prices will occur on **Thursday**, when the average price will rise to nearly nine cents. Thursday's price peak will take place in the morning hours from 07:00 to 09:00, around 15 cents. This day also carries a significant risk of price spikes, with individual hourly prices potentially rising as high as 20â€“40 cents. The lowest wind power generation occurs on the same day, partly explaining the elevated price level.

Prices will fall significantly on **Friday**, with electricity prices even dipping negative during the early morning hours. Friday's average price will remain slightly above two cents. On **Saturday**, concluding the week, prices will stay moderately just above three cents on average. However, Saturday also holds a risk of price spikes, with individual hourly prices potentially rising to around ten cents at most.
