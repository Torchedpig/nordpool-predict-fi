The electricity price forecast for the coming days reveals notable variations. Early in the week, prices on **Wednesday** will remain very low. The average price will hover around zero (-0.0 ¢/kWh), and during nighttime hours, prices will even drop into the negatives, reaching as low as -2.1 cents. The day's highest price will also be modest, only 0.6 ¢.

On Thursday, the situation will change markedly. **Thursday's** average price will rise to 4.8 cents, and the most expensive period will occur around 8–10 in the morning, with prices reaching up to 17.5 cents. Additionally, a significant risk of price spikes is forecast for Thursday, meaning individual hourly prices could potentially be 10–20 cents higher than currently predicted. This peak coincides precisely with morning hours between 8–10, when wind power production will be very low, at only 1371 MW.

Prices will stabilize again at a lower level on Friday and through the weekend. On **Friday**, the average price will be roughly two cents, with prices fluctuating from negative nighttime prices (-0.8 ¢) to evening highs of 7.3 cents. Saturday's price structure will follow a similar pattern, averaging 2.6 cents and varying between -1.3 and 6.4 cents. Sunday will be one of the week's cheapest days, with an average price of 0.9 cents, and even the day's maximum price will remain moderate at 3.3 cents.

At the beginning of next week, electricity prices will again turn upward. On **Monday**, the average price will climb to 4.5 cents, with the day's highest price occurring between 20–22 in the evening, potentially reaching as high as 9.8 cents. Tuesday's average price will remain elevated at 4.6 ¢, and there is also a predicted risk of isolated price spikes approaching the ten-cent level. Wind power production on Tuesday will be lower than average (averaging 2222 MW), which could contribute to possible price increases during the evening hours.

Therefore, price fluctuations in the coming days are noteworthy. Particularly during Thursday morning and Tuesday evening, electricity users should prepare for temporarily elevated prices.
