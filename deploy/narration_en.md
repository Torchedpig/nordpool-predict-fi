Electricity price expectations will vary considerably in the coming days. Both very cheap and more expensive days are expected.

On **Saturday**, the average price of electricity will fall to -0.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. The price will stay around zero, varying between -1.2 and 0.1 cents. On Saturday, there will be plenty of wind power available, which explains the low price level.

On **Sunday**, the price will rise slightly from Saturday, with an average price of 1.7 ¢/kWh. On Sunday, the price will vary from -0.1 cents to 3.8 cents. Wind power production will decrease somewhat, but will still remain at a reasonable level.

Next **Monday**, the average price of electricity will settle at 0.9 cents per kilowatt-hour. The price will vary between -0.7 and 1.6 cents. Strong wind power is forecast for Monday, which will keep the price low. Next **Tuesday**, the average price of electricity will rise to 2.8 cents. Tuesday's price range is from -1.1 cents to 5.7 cents per kilowatt-hour.

Next **Wednesday**, the average price of electricity will continue to rise, being 4.3 ¢/kWh. Wednesday's price will move between 1.3 and 8.0 cents. Wind power production will remain fairly stable, but not quite at the same high level as at the beginning of the week.

Next **Thursday** will be the most expensive day of the week. The average price of electricity will rise to 8.6 cents per kilowatt-hour, and the price will vary from 2.5 cents to 13.4 cents. Wind power production will decrease significantly on Thursday, which will increase the price. In addition, on Thursday there is a risk of individual price spikes, even up to 20-40 cents per kilowatt-hour. The price peaks would likely be during the morning and evening hours, around 7-9 AM and 5-7 PM.

Next **Friday**, the average price of electricity will fall to 5.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. Friday's price will vary from 1.8 cents to 14.9 cents. Wind power production will recover slightly from Thursday, but will still remain quite low.
