The upcoming week's electricity price forecast shows variation, especially on **Tuesday** and **Sunday**. Tuesday's average price rises to 11.1 cents per kilowatt-hour, which is the highest expected average price of the week. On Tuesday, electricity prices may vary greatly, with the day's maximum price potentially reaching 36.8 cents. This price fluctuation may be due to the large variation in wind power production, with production at its lowest at under 700 megawatts and peaking at over 6500 megawatts.

**Wednesday** is forecasted to be the cheapest day of the week, with an average price of 3.3 cents. There is plenty of wind power, which partly explains the low prices. After midweek, on **Thursday** and **Friday**, prices remain more stable, with average prices of 8.0 and 7.5 cents. On these days, price fluctuations remain moderate, and no major spikes are expected.

**Saturday** continues the downward trend in prices, with an average price of 5.9 cents. Sunday's price development is interesting because, although the average price is 8.8 cents, there is a warning of possible price spikes that could rise to 20 cents in individual hours. This may be due to the low minimum wind power production, which drops below 900 megawatts.

Next **Monday**, price development is expected to be moderate, although the risk of price spikes remains. The day's forecasted average price is 7.9 cents, and wind power production remains at a reasonable level. Throughout the week, temperatures remain below -2 °C but do not reach the thresholds of exceptionally cold weather. Thus, the temperature's impact on price development is minimal.
