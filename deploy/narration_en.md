Electricity prices will fluctuate notably during the upcoming days. **Wednesday** will be the week's most expensive day, with an expected average spot price of 8.2 cents per kilowatt hour. The price range on Wednesday will be relatively narrow, from 4.8¢ to 14.6¢, but peak prices might occur around 8:00–10:00 in the morning. Additionally, there is a risk of price spikes on Wednesday, with hourly prices potentially reaching as high as 20 cents.

The elevated price on Wednesday can be explained by exceptionally low wind power production. Wind generation will average only 570 MW throughout the day. This is significantly below normal levels, clearly pushing electricity prices upward. Wednesday's minimum wind production will dip as low as 196 MW during midday hours.

On other days, electricity prices will remain notably lower. **Tuesday's** prices will vary greatly: during early morning hours, the price will briefly dip slightly negative (-0.1¢), but in the evening between 21:00 and 23:00, prices will surge to over 25 cents. Tuesday's highest hourly price, 27.8¢, is also the week's single highest hourly rate.

**Thursday** is a public holiday, reflected in lower electricity prices. The day's average price will be only 2.6 cents, and the price range fairly narrow (0.5–5.5¢). Due to the holiday, electricity demand is expected to be lower than usual, explaining the reduced prices. There is, however, a risk of price spikes on Thursday, possibly pushing hourly prices up to 10 cents.

The end of the week appears very affordable. **Friday's** average price will be 2.1¢, and during the weekend, prices will stay even lower. On **Saturday**, the average electricity price is only 0.8 cents, and on **Sunday**, 1.5 cents. Prices will momentarily even turn negative on both days. These low weekend prices result from high wind power production, significantly exceeding normal levels.

Next **Monday**, prices will rise slightly from weekend levels but remain moderate, with an average of 3.9 cents. Price volatility will remain modest, ranging from 0.7 to 7.0¢.
