The market price for electricity will vary considerably in the coming days. The highest average price of the week will occur immediately on **Wednesday**, with a forecasted average of 19.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. Price variations within Wednesday will be significant: the day's peak price is expected in the morning hours between 6 AM and 8 AM, when electricity could cost as much as 37.6 cents. This peak is particularly driven by extremely weak wind power production, dipping to as low as 210 megawatts.

On **Thursday**, the electricity price will decrease notably compared to the previous day, averaging around 5.6 cents. Thursday is a public holiday, which typically reduces demand and keeps prices moderate. Prices will remain reasonable during the morning but will drop further in the evening, starting from 10 PM, as strong wind power production pushes the price down to below two cents. However, there remains a clear risk of temporary price spikes on Thursday, and electricity prices may reach as high as 20 cents during isolated hours.

Throughout the weekend, from **Friday** to **Sunday**, electricity prices will remain very low. **Friday's** average price will fall to only 1.8 cents, reaching its lowest point around 0.7 cents overnight between 2 AM and 4 AM. This low pricing is primarily due to abundant wind power production, averaging nearly 5300 megawatts on Friday.

Prices will continue to stay low on **Saturday** and **Sunday**. Saturday's price level will remain very affordable, averaging only 1.7 cents. On Sunday, the average price will increase slightly, yet still remain inexpensive at 2.6 cents.

As the new week begins on **Monday**, prices will start to rise again. Monday's average price will reach 5.7 cents, and on Tuesday it will increase further to 6.8 cents. Tuesday evening could also experience temporary price spikes, potentially reaching as high as 20 cents during isolated hours. Tuesday's weak wind power production, averaging only around 2400 megawatts, will contribute to this price increase.
