Next week's electricity prices will fluctuate significantly. The week's cheapest day will be **Sunday**, when the average electricity price will remain below two cents per kilowatt-hour. Early Sunday morning, between 03:00 and 05:00, the price is even forecast to dip into negative territory, reaching as low as -0.4 cents. The lower energy demand typical of a holiday, combined with strong wind power production, explains Sunday's notably low prices. However, there is a small risk of individual price spikes up to 10 cents on Sunday.

The highest electricity prices will occur midweek. On **Wednesday**, the week's highest daily average price is expected to be around 10.0 cents per kilowatt-hour. Prices on Wednesday will range from 6.2 cents to over 17 cents. The highest prices will occur in the morning hours between 07:00 and 09:00, when prices rise above 17 cents per kilowatt-hour. Wednesday's price variation is partly due to low wind power production, averaging only around 1004 MW. Wednesday also carries a high risk of price spikes, potentially pushing hourly prices significantly above the maximum shown in the table, up to 20–40 cents.

On **Tuesday** and **Thursday**, average prices will also remain high, around 9 cents. On both days, wind power generation remains low, contributing to elevated prices. Both days also carry a high risk of price spikes, meaning hourly prices could significantly exceed the maximum prices indicated in the table, potentially reaching 20–40 cents per kilowatt-hour.

**Saturday**, the start of the weekend, will be a day of considerable price variation. Early morning hours will be relatively inexpensive, but in the evening between 19:00 and 21:00, the price will rise above 15 cents. Saturday's minimum wind power production is very low, which partly explains the high maximum price and significant price fluctuations.

The last weekday, **Friday**, will have more moderate pricing. The average electricity price on Friday will remain below five cents per kilowatt-hour. However, Friday also has a minor risk of price spikes, during which hourly prices might momentarily rise up to approximately 10 cents.
