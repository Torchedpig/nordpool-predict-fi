The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The maintenance began on 1 March 2025 at 03:00 and is estimated to end on 2 May 2025 at 02:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of electricity price forecasts, as training data from similar periods is limited.

Next week's electricity market prices will vary noticeably from day to day. Prices will remain relatively low at the start of the week, but midweek will bring a considerable increase.

The lowest electricity prices of the week will occur on **Sunday**, **Tuesday**, and next **Saturday**. On these days, average prices will remain clearly below one cent per kilowatt-hour. **Tuesday** will also see the week's lowest hourly rate, dipping as low as -1.4 cents during the early morning hours between 01:00 and 03:00. Negative hourly prices will also occur on **Sunday**, Friday, and next Saturday, especially during nighttime.

A significant exception to these low prices will be **Wednesday**, when the expected average electricity price will rise to 8.6 cents. Wednesday will experience an exceptionally wide price range: the lowest hourly price at night will be just 1.6 cents, but prices may peak around 15.1 ¢ between 07:00 and 09:00 in the morning. Additionally, Wednesday carries a significant risk of price spikes, potentially driving hourly prices up to 20–40 cents.

On **Thursday**, prices will decrease slightly from Wednesday's levels but remain relatively high, averaging around 6 cents. The highest prices on Thursday are expected between 08:00 and 10:00 in the morning, reaching approximately 12 cents. By **Friday**, average electricity prices will drop significantly from Thursday, settling around 3 cents. Approaching the weekend, price levels will stabilize further.
