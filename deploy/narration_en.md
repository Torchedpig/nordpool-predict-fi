*The spot electricity price for the coming week will vary significantly depending on the day. The highest price levels are expected on Thursday and Friday, while Sunday is forecast to be particularly affordable. For almost every day, there is a risk of potential price spikes during individual hours.*

A production shortfall is ongoing at the Loviisa 2 nuclear power plant, with only 3 MW available out of the nominal 248.0 MW, resulting in an availability of 1.2 percent. The incident began on May 4 at 5:00 p.m. and is expected to end on May 6 at 8:00 p.m. The outage may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as there is limited training data available from periods of nuclear power outages.

The forecast was updated on Tuesday at 12:06 p.m.

Electricity price forecasts for the coming week show some variation, especially between midweek and the weekend. **Thursday** and **Friday** stand out with clearly higher average prices, 4.4 and 4.9 cents per kilowatt hour. On both days, the maximum prices also exceed seven cents. On these days, wind power production drops exceptionally low, especially on Thursday when wind generation briefly falls below 400 megawatts. This explains both the higher average prices and the daily peaks.

**Wednesday** will see the average price at a slightly lower level, around three cents. Wind power production on Wednesday will reach its highest levels of the week, which keeps prices in check. Between Wednesday and Saturday, price levels remain moderate, and on Saturday, the maximum price stays at 4.6 cents.

**Sunday** is expected to reflect the impact of a public holiday, when electricity demand is typically lower. This is also visible in the prices: the day‚Äôs average price drops to 1.7 cents, and the lowest hourly price even goes negative, dipping to -0.7 cents. Wind power production on Sunday remains slightly higher than the weekly average, which also supports the low price.

At the start of the week, **Monday** and **Tuesday** average prices rise again to just above three cents. On both days, wind power production stays relatively low, and on Tuesday the maximum price reaches 8.2 cents. Hourly price fluctuations may be significant throughout the week, especially from Thursday to Friday, with models indicating a risk of price spikes up to ten cents during morning and evening hours.

Overall, the week is expected to be variable in terms of prices, but the most affordable day will be Sunday. The highest price moments will concentrate on Thursday and Friday, when wind power is at its lowest. There is a stated risk of price spikes for almost every day, so actual hourly prices may differ significantly from the forecast.
