*Electricity prices will fluctuate significantly over the coming days: prices will be lowest on Friday, even dipping into negative territory, while early next week and on Thursday, price spikes up to 20 cents may occur due to reduced wind power generation.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is undergoing a maintenance outage, which began on 1.3.2025 at 03:00 and is expected to conclude on 2.5.2025 at 02:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of electricity price forecasts, as training data during outage periods is limited.

Electricity prices will vary markedly in the coming days. The lowest-price day will be **Friday**, when average prices will dip slightly below zero, at -0.1 Â¢/kWh. Throughout Friday, prices will remain very low, reaching their lowest point of -0.6 Â¢ during the nighttime hours. This is due to abundant wind power, averaging nearly 6,000 MW for the day.

Over the weekend, prices will begin to rise. On **Saturday**, the average price will increase moderately to 2.4 cents, but on **Sunday**, prices will rise further. The average price on Sunday will reach five cents, with potential price spikes as high as 10 cents, especially during the morning hours between 9:00 and 11:00. This will be influenced by significantly lower wind power generation, which will dip as low as around 1,000 MW.

The start of the week will bring even higher prices. On **Monday**, the expected average price is 7 cents, and during the day, prices could momentarily spike up to 20 cents. Monday's price spikes are expected in the morning hours, particularly between 8:00 and 10:00, when wind power generation will be at its lowest, around 1,700 MW.

**Tuesday** and **Wednesday** will see prices decrease again. On Tuesday, the average electricity price will be approximately 3.3 cents, without significant price spikes anticipated. Wednesday will experience another sharp drop, averaging only 0.4 cents due to abundant wind power availability. Throughout Wednesday, wind power generation will remain exceptionally high, above 5,000 MW.

On **Thursday**, prices will rise again. The day's average price will reach 5.6 cents, with a significant risk of high price spikes. On Thursday, prices may momentarily climb as high as 20 cents, especially during the morning hours between 9:00 and 11:00, when wind power production will be at its lowest, around 1,100 MW.
