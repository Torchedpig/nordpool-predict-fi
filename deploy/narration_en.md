The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage. The outage started on 01.03.2025 at 03:00 and is estimated to end on 02.05.2025 at 02:00. This outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data available during maintenance periods is limited.

Electricity prices for the upcoming week will vary, although average prices will remain relatively moderate most days. As the week begins on **Monday**, the average electricity price will be around 2.4 cents per kilowatt-hour, with peak prices slightly above five cents occurring in the evening between 18:00 and 20:00.

**Wednesday** stands out as clearly the most expensive day of the week. On that day, average prices will rise to eight cents per kilowatt-hour. At certain hours, particularly around 8:00 in the morning, prices will approach nearly 13 cents. The forecast for Wednesday indicates a significant risk of price spikes, with potential prices reaching as high as 20‚Äì30 cents during individual hours. This is related to Wednesday's notably low minimum wind power production, which will momentarily drop below 1000 MW in the morning hours.

From Thursday onwards, prices will return to more moderate levels. **Thursday's** average price will be about six cents, with the highest prices occurring around 9:00 in the morning. On Friday, electricity prices will again stabilize around three cents, and over the weekend prices will decrease further.

During the weekend, on Saturday and Sunday, the average electricity price will remain very moderate. On **Sunday**, the average price will even be slightly negative at -0.1 cents per kilowatt-hour. Negative prices are likely especially during night and early morning hours, when electricity consumption is low and wind power generation is abundant.

The week's lowest prices will occur on Sunday afternoon between approximately 13:00 and 15:00, when electricity prices fall to around -1.5 cents. These hours might provide particularly advantageous pricing for electricity users.
