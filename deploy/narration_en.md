*Next week, spot electricity prices are expected to remain moderate on most days, but individual hours may see unusually high spikes. On Sunday, electricity will be noticeably cheaper, while towards the end of the week, low wind power production will lift prices during certain hours.*

A maintenance outage at the Loviisa 2 nuclear power plant began on May 4, 2025 at 5:00 p.m. and is expected to end on May 6, 2025 at 8:00 p.m. This outage may affect the accuracy of price forecasts, as there is only limited training data available for such situations.

Electricity prices for the week will mostly stay below four cents, but there may be significant fluctuations during individual hours. On **Tuesday**, the average price will remain low, and daily price variation is expected to be moderate. No exceptional price spikes are forecast for that day.

On **Wednesday**, **Thursday**, **Friday**, **Saturday**, **Sunday**, and **Monday**, there is a risk of price spikes reaching up to 10 cents during certain hours. On **Wednesday**, the highest hourly price will occur in the morning between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., when electricity may be significantly more expensive than at other times. Similar risks of spikes are present on **Thursday** between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m., **Friday** between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m., and **Saturday** between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m., when momentary prices may rise well above the table's maximum values if wind production is lower than expected. On **Monday**, the highest hourly price is expected in the morning between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m.

The cheapest day of the week will be **Sunday**, with an average price dropping to 1.4 cents and the lowest hourly price at 0.2 cents. This coincides with a public holiday, when electricity demand is typically lower. At the same time, the highest average price of the week will be seen on **Friday** (4.0 ¢), but **Monday** may also see prices peaking at 7.8 cents within the day. The most expensive hours of the week will generally fall in the morning and evening, when demand usually increases.

Wind power production will remain at a low level throughout the week, especially on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, when average wind production stays well below 1,500 megawatts. This relatively low output will push both average and peak electricity prices up, particularly towards the end of the week. Temperatures will remain mild for the season and are not expected to affect electricity pricing.
