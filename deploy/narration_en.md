The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant maintenance break started on 1.3.2025 at 03:00 and is expected to continue until 28.4.2025 at 01:00. The maintenance break may affect the accuracy of price forecasts, as training data from periods with nuclear plant outages is limited.

In the upcoming week, significant differences in electricity prices will occur between days. The week's highest expected price will be seen on **Friday**, when the hourly price may reach as high as around 38 cents. This price peak will occur in the morning hours between 7:00â€“9:00. Friday's average price will be around 12.1 Â¢, making it clearly the highest daily average of the week.

On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, price levels will be significantly lower, and during certain hours, prices may even turn negative. On **Saturday**, the average daily price will fall below two cents, ranging from -2.1 Â¢ to 9.1 Â¢. However, there is a risk of price spikes, with individual hourly prices potentially rising up to around 10 cents. On **Sunday**, the average will be slightly higher, around four cents, but similar price spikes are again possible.

Prices will rise slightly again on **Monday** and **Tuesday** but will remain moderate. On **Monday**, the average price is expected to be slightly below six cents, with the day's highest price potentially reaching nearly 14 cents between 8:00â€“10:00 in the morning. There is also a risk of even higher price spikes up to 20 cents. On **Tuesday**, prices will be slightly lower, averaging five cents, but hourly prices might still approach ten cents. The risk of price spikes will remain, possibly reaching around 10 cents on individual hours.

On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, price levels will drop significantly, and prices may be negative for much of the day. **Thursday** is also a public holiday, during which electricity demand may be lower than usual, further reducing prices.
