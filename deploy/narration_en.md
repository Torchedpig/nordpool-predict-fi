Next week, electricity prices will vary somewhat on different days. **Friday** and **Saturday** are relatively affordable, with average prices below five cents. On **Friday**, price expectations range between 0.4 and 7.3 cents. There is abundant wind power on that day, which contributes to the moderation of prices. **Saturday** sees slightly cheaper average prices, but the range is between 1.4 and 7.5 cents.

On **Sunday**, electricity price expectations rise, with the day's average price at 7.0 cents. Wind power production remains low, partly explaining the increase in prices. On Monday, prices rise further, with an average price of 9.4 cents. This is the highest average price of the week, and the risk of price spikes is significant. Peak prices could rise to 20-40 cents in individual hours.

**Tuesday** sees prices stabilizing somewhat with an average price of 7.1 cents. The amount of wind power remains close to normal levels. **Wednesday** sees prices falling further, with an average price of 5.3 cents. High wind power production contributes to the price decrease. At the end of the week, on **Thursday**, prices rise again with an average price of 7.0 cents. The variation in wind power production impacts price expectations.

Overall, next week will see quite a bit of fluctuation in electricity prices, with significant price spikes expected on Monday. ðŸ’¡
