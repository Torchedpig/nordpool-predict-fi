The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage. It started on 1.3.2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on 2.5.2025 at 02:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as limited training data is available from periods of maintenance outages.

Electricity prices in the coming week will experience fairly significant day-to-day fluctuations. The cheapest day of the week will be **Sunday**, with the average price expected to remain very low, around 0.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. Early morning and afternoon on Sunday will even see negative prices, dropping as low as -1.4 cents between 13:00–15:00. Sunday's maximum price will remain modest, peaking at 4.1 cents around 22:00.

The week's highest prices, however, will occur on **Wednesday**, when the average price will rise to 7.7 cents, and the maximum price will soar to 16.8 cents during the morning hours, approximately between 08:00–10:00. Wednesday also carries a high risk of price spikes, during which the hourly price could increase to as high as 20–30 cents. The peak prices coincide with morning consumption peaks, when wind power generation will be particularly low, reaching a minimum of just 810 megawatts. This low wind generation explains the exceptionally high maximum price on Wednesday.

**Saturday** also stands out somewhat as a higher-priced day. Its average price is expected to be around 6.1 cents, but especially during the morning hours, roughly between 09:00–11:00, the price may rise up to 12 cents. Saturday also carries a notable risk of price spikes, potentially pushing hourly prices as high as 20–30 cents.

On **Friday**, **Monday**, and **Thursday**, electricity prices will remain relatively affordable, with average prices ranging between 2–3 cents. During these days, the risk of price spikes will be lower, although individual hourly prices could briefly rise above 10 cents. The affordable pricing on Friday and Monday can particularly be attributed to the fact that both days are public holidays. Electricity consumption on holidays is typically lower, thus decreasing the price.

Overall, the week's price development will clearly reflect fluctuations where wind power levels significantly impact pricing. Notable characteristics include negative prices on Sunday as well as high risks of price spikes on Saturday and Wednesday.
