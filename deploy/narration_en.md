The electricity price forecast for the week clearly shows a low price level. In the coming days, electricity spot prices will remain below two cents per kilowatt-hour on average. The greatest price variation occurs on **Wednesday**, when the electricity price will rise above four cents between 18:00 and 20:00. The highest hourly price of the week, 4.7 cents, will occur precisely during early Wednesday evening.

On **Thursday** and **Friday**, prices will remain moderate, and no significant fluctuations are expected. Thursday's price level will be very low, with electricity prices even turning negative during the early morning hours. Friday morning will also feature negative prices, although daytime prices will rise to a modest two-cent level.

On **Saturday**, prices will remain similarly low, although between 07:00 and 09:00 prices will slightly exceed three cents. Saturday afternoon will feature the week's lowest price point, -1.9 cents at around 14:00.

**Sunday** stands out with a negative average price for the entire day, at -0.1 cents per kilowatt-hour. However, hourly prices within the day will vary.

Early next week, **Monday** and **Tuesday** will continue the trend of low prices. On Monday morning between 08:00 and 10:00, prices will rise above four cents, but otherwise the day's prices remain very affordable.
