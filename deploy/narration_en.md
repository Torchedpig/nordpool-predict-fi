Electricity market prices will exhibit significant variation in the coming days. The lowest prices of the week will occur on **Sunday**, when the average price will be only 1.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Sunday, the price will even go negative, reaching as low as -0.7 cents between 13:00 and 15:00.

The most expensive day of the week will be **Wednesday**, when the average electricity price will rise to 9.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. The risk of price spikes on Wednesday will be notably higher than on other days. Prices for individual hours could rise as high as 20–40 cents. Wednesday's highest predicted price, 15.5 cents, will occur in the morning between 07:00 and 09:00.

Elevated average prices will also be seen on **Tuesday** and **Thursday**, at 7.2 and 8.2 cents per kilowatt-hour, respectively. Both days also carry the possibility of price spikes. On Tuesday, hourly prices could reach up to 20 cents, with the highest price expected in the evening around 20:00–22:00. On Thursday, a similar price spike could occur in the morning between 07:00 and 09:00.

On **Saturday** and **Friday**, prices will remain at more moderate levels: Saturday's average price will be 5.4 cents, and Friday's average price will be 4.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. Nonetheless, the possibility of price spikes exists on both days. On Saturday, the risk particularly concerns morning hours, whereas Friday's prices may rise in the afternoon or evening, especially between 08:00 and 10:00.

**Monday** is a public holiday, potentially lowering electricity demand and thus slightly reducing prices. The average price will remain at 4.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, but the possibility of price spikes still exists. On Monday, prices for individual hours could rise up to 10 cents.
