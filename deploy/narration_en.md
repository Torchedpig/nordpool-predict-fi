The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The outage started on March 1, 2025, at 03:00 and is expected to continue until May 2, 2025, at 02:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast due to limited training data available during such outages.

Electricity prices will show clear fluctuations in the coming days. The week's highest prices will occur on **Thursday**, when the hourly electricity price may rise above 17 cents per kilowatt-hour. The most expensive moment is expected in the morning between 8:00 and 10:00, when the price is forecasted to peak at 17.2 cents. Thursday's average price will be around 4.9 cents, which will be the week's highest daily average.

Thursday's significant price variation is clearly related to wind power production. At its lowest, wind power production will be only 554 MW, explaining the higher price peaks. There will also be an increased risk for even higher price spikes on Thursday, potentially raising prices to 10‚Äì20 cents during individual hours.

Over the weekend, electricity will be considerably cheaper. On **Friday**, the average price will drop to 2.5 cents, and during nighttime, prices will turn negative, reaching as low as -0.9 cents. On **Saturday**, prices will remain stable between 0.5 and 7.1 cents, with an average price even lower than Friday, at around 2.2 cents. On **Sunday**, the average price will fall to the week's lowest point, around 0.7 cents, again including negative prices as low as -0.6 cents during early morning hours.

At the beginning of next week, prices will moderately rise again. On **Monday**, the average price will be around 1.1 cents, and negative pricing will continue to occur during early morning hours. On **Tuesday**, slightly greater fluctuations will appear again, with the average price rising to 2.4 cents and the day's peak price approaching nearly ten cents in the evening between 19:00 and 21:00. On **Wednesday**, prices will continue their upward trend, with the daily average climbing to 4.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. Daytime and evening prices will be considerably higher than earlier in the week, and there will be a risk of price spikes. Individual hourly prices could reach approximately 10 cents.

The week's price fluctuations are mainly due to variations in wind power production. The highest price periods will occur especially in the mornings and evenings, when electricity demand is higher and wind power production lower.
