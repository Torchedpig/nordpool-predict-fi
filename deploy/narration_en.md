Electricity prices for the upcoming week are expected to vary considerably from day to day. Early in the week, prices will reach higher levels, while from Wednesday onward, the price level will decrease significantly.

The most expensive day of the week will be **Monday**, when the average electricity price is expected to reach 8.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. Monday will also see the highest individual price peak, forecasted at 22.9 ¬¢, occurring during the morning hours between 8:00-10:00. The risk of price spikes will remain high on **Tuesday** as well, with a peak price potentially reaching 15.9 cents in the morning between 7:00-9:00. On both days, the minimum wind power production will remain low, partially explaining the high peak prices.

From Wednesday onward, the price level will become significantly lower. On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, negative minimum prices are even anticipated during nighttime. Wednesday's lowest price will be -0.7 cents around 20:00-22:00 in the evening. On Thursday, the price will drop even lower, reaching -1.1 cents during the afternoon between 14:00-16:00. On both days, wind power production will be abundant, contributing to the low price levels.

Towards the end of the week, price fluctuations will stabilize further. On **Friday**, electricity prices are expected to remain low, with an average daily price of only 1.2 cents. Price variations on Friday will remain minimal, with a modest maximum price of 2.7 cents.

The weekend days, **Saturday** and **Sunday**, will have average prices below four cents. Sunday's public holiday may reduce electricity demand, thus keeping prices moderate. However, on Sunday, there will be a possibility of price spikes during individual hours.
