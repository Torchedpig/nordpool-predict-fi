The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is undergoing a maintenance outage. The outage began on 1.3.2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on 2.5.2025 at 02:00. Due to the outage, the accuracy of this forecast may be somewhat limited, as historical data from outage periods is limited.

Electricity market price expectations for next week will be affordable. The average daily prices will remain below five cents throughout the week. Price levels will be lowest on **Sunday**, with an average price of only 0.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Sunday, electricity prices will even dip into negative territory overnight and in the afternoon, reaching as low as -1.3 cents between 18:00 and 20:00.

**Saturday's** and **Monday's** average prices will also be very low, at 1.1 and 1.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. On these days, electricity prices will briefly drop below zero, especially late at night and early in the morning. The lowest price will be -1.4 cents early Monday morning between 03:00 and 05:00.

The week's highest prices will occur on **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**. Of these, Wednesday's average price will be the week's highest at 4.8 cents per kilowatt-hour, and hourly prices could rise above 10 cents at certain times. On Tuesday, the highest hourly price is forecasted at 9.5 cents in the morning between 08:00 and 10:00. The higher price levels on these days are partly explained by lower wind power production, which falls below 2000 MW at its lowest point.

On **Thursday** and **Friday**, price levels will return slightly lower, averaging 3.8 and 3.0 cents per kilowatt-hour respectively. Friday is a public holiday, which may reduce electricity demand and help keep prices moderate.

Overall, the coming week will offer affordable electricity for consumers. However, price fluctuations will be significant, particularly on Wednesday and Tuesday, when electricity prices will temporarily rise significantly higher than on other days.
