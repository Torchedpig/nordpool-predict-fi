The price forecast for exchange electricity for the coming week looks quite volatile. There will be both very expensive and very cheap days.

On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, electricity prices will be high, with average prices above 13 cents per kilowatt-hour. The average price for Wednesday is expected to be as high as 15.7 ¢, and the price could peak at 21.5 cents. There is also a high risk of price spikes on Wednesday and Thursday. On Wednesday, prices for individual hours could rise to as much as 40-60 cents, and on Thursday to 30-50 cents. The price peaks are likely to occur in the morning around 7-9 am or in the early evening around 5-7 pm. The high prices are explained by low wind power. On Wednesday, wind power is forecast to average only 338 MW during the day, and on Thursday only 624 MW. The minimum wind power production forecast for Wednesday and Thursday is only a few hundred megawatts, which partly explains the high prices.

On **Friday**, price expectations will already be falling significantly. The average price for the day will be less than six cents, and wind power will already be considerably more available, averaging 3622 MW. There is still a risk of price spikes on Friday, up to 20 cents, most likely in the morning at 7-9 am or in the evening at 5-7 pm.

At the weekend, the price of exchange electricity will fall very low, with the average price for **Saturday** forecast to be only 1.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Saturday, negative prices are expected in the afternoon around 12-6 pm, when electricity is practically paid to the consumer. On **Sunday**, the average price will rise slightly, but will still remain below three cents. The low prices at the weekend are explained by very abundant wind power: on Saturday, wind power will be available at an average of 4525 MW and on Sunday at 4027 MW.

Next **Monday** and **Tuesday**, exchange electricity prices will rise slightly from the weekend, but will still remain quite moderate. Average prices will be around five cents. Wind power will be abundant and no significant price spikes are expected.
