The electricity price forecast for the upcoming week shows clear variations between days. Early in the week, especially on **Tuesday**, prices will rise noticeably. Tuesday‚Äôs average price will be the highest, at 14.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. The maximum price on Tuesday will be 23.9 ¬¢, but there is a high risk of price spikes. During certain hours on Tuesday morning around 9‚Äì11 and in the evening around 19‚Äì21, prices may even rise to 30‚Äì60 cents.

On **Thursday**, average electricity prices will also be relatively high, around 10.2 ¬¢. Prices are expected to vary between 4.2 and 20 cents within the day. The risk of price spikes is elevated on Thursday as well, and during certain hours around 8‚Äì9 in the morning, the price could temporarily rise to the 30‚Äì40 ¬¢ range.

On **Wednesday**, prices will be somewhat lower than on Tuesday and Thursday, yet still relatively high. Wednesday‚Äôs average price will be 8.9 ¬¢. However, price spikes may occur especially around nine in the morning, when prices could temporarily rise to 20‚Äì40 cents.

Lower wind power production partly explains higher midweek prices. For example, on Tuesday, the minimum wind power generation is only 459 MW, contributing to the higher maximum price. Wind production also remains low on Thursday and Wednesday, further driving up prices.

Toward the end of the week, prices will become much more affordable. On **Friday**, the average price will drop below four cents, with no risk of price spikes. On **Sunday**, electricity prices will fall to the lowest levels of the week, with an average price of just half a cent. Negative prices will even occur on Sunday, reaching a low of -2.0 cents.

The week begins with a holiday (**Monday**), during which electricity demand may be lower than usual. This is reflected in a relatively moderate average price, although the maximum price between 19‚Äì21 in the evening will reach 18.6 cents.
