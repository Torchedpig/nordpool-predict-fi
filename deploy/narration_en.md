The electricity price forecast for the coming week indicates several very affordable days. Daily average prices fluctuate mostly around one cent, and on several days the average price even goes negative. **Sunday** particularly stands out as inexpensive, with an average daily price forecast at -0,9 cents per kilowatt-hour. **Thursday‚Äôs** average price also remains clearly negative, at -0,6 cents.

The week's highest single hourly price occurs on **Tuesday**, when electricity prices momentarily rise to 12,6 cents between 8‚Äì10 in the morning. Tuesday's elevated peak price is explained by low minimum wind power production in the morning hours, just 613 megawatts. On other days, electricity prices remain significantly more moderate, with maximum prices mostly staying below four cents.

Mid-week, especially on **Wednesday** and Thursday, numerous negative hourly prices are forecasted. Wind power production on both days is particularly high, averaging 3745 megawatts on Wednesday and as much as 4373 megawatts on Thursday. The abundant wind power supply keeps electricity prices low, especially during nighttime and morning hours.

Weekend prices continue to remain low. On **Saturday**, the average price is barely positive at 0,1 cents, while on Sunday it clearly dips negative. The weekend sees no significant intraday price fluctuations; electricity remains consistently affordable throughout the days.

By next **Monday**, prices will rise slightly, but remain at low levels overall. The average daily price will rise to 1,4 cents, and in the evening hours the week's second-highest hourly price of 6,6 cents occurs between 18‚Äì20.

Overall, the coming week's electricity price forecast promises consumers very affordable days, sometimes even with electricity prices turning negative.
