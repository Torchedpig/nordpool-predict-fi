Electricity price fluctuations will be significant during the upcoming week. Regarding price differences, the week will be clearly divided into two parts: early in the week prices will be higher, while towards the end of the week they will drop considerably.

The most expensive day of the week will be **Monday**, when the average price will reach 6.8 cents and individual hourly prices may rise up to almost 15 cents between 8â€“10 in the morning. Additionally, Monday carries a high risk of price spikes, potentially pushing hourly prices as high as 20â€“30 cents. This price increase can partly be explained by very low wind power generation, with the minimum level at only 355 MW.

On **Tuesday**, prices will decrease slightly compared to Monday, but will still remain relatively high. The average price will stay below six cents, although the risk of price spikes remains, and hourly prices may rise up to 20 cents.

On **Wednesday**, price levels will fall further, averaging just above four cents. The risk of price spikes will also decrease compared to previous days, though individual hourly prices may still rise up to about 10 cents.

**Thursday** is a public holiday, which may reduce energy consumption, thus lowering prices. Thursday's average price will be only 2.8 cents, and individual hours may even have negative pricing. However, occasional price spikes might still occur, causing hourly prices to rise up to 10 cents.

The cheapest day of the week will be **Friday**, with an average electricity price below one cent per kilowatt-hour. On Friday, hourly prices will mostly remain very low, even negative during early morning hours. Prices will also remain affordable on **Saturday**, with an average price below two cents.
