The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is undergoing maintenance. It started on 1.3.2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on 2.5.2025 at 02:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as the available training data from maintenance periods is limited.

Electricity prices in the coming week will vary significantly from day to day. The week will start with moderate prices, but clearly higher price levels are expected around mid-week.

**Monday** is a public holiday, resulting in lower than usual electricity demand. Prices will be low, averaging 2.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. The cheapest hours will occur in the early morning between 4‚Äì6 AM, when the price may drop close to zero. In the evening from 6‚Äì8 PM, prices will peak at close to six cents, and there is a risk of price spikes on individual hours, potentially up to 10 cents.

On **Tuesday**, prices will rise notably, with the average price increasing to 9.4 cents and the highest hourly prices exceeding 15 cents. The highest prices are expected in the morning between 8‚Äì10 AM, and in the evening between 7‚Äì9 PM. Wind power production will be exceptionally low, with a minimum of only 675 MW. This extremely low wind power generation explains the day's highest prices. There is a high risk of price spikes, and individual hourly prices may rise as high as 20‚Äì40 cents.

On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, prices will remain relatively high, averaging 6.3 and 9.5 cents respectively. Thursday's highest price between 7‚Äì9 AM will reach almost 17 cents, and the risk of price spikes is significant, potentially up to 20‚Äì40 cents. The wind power production on Thursday will be low, with a minimum level of only 778 MW, partly explaining the higher price expectations.

Towards the end of the week, prices will decrease. **Friday** will be the cheapest day of the week, with an average price of just 2.4 cents and no risk of price spikes. Saturday and Sunday continue with affordable prices, but both days carry a slight risk of price spikes up to 10 cents during individual hours.
