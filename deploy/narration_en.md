*Next week's electricity prices will fluctuate significantly: early-week price spikes and occasional negative prices highlight an unstable market situation, also affected by the maintenance outage at the Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage. The outage began on 1 March 2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on 2 May 2025 at 02:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of price forecasts, as training data during outages is limited.

Forecast updated on Sunday at 21:01.

On **Thursday**, prices will rise again slightly, but the day's average price will remain affordable, slightly above three cents. Thursdayâ€™s morning hours between 7:00 and 9:00 are pricier compared to the rest of the day, with prices climbing above 14 cents per kilowatt-hour. On **Friday**, prices drop again, resulting in the week's lowest daily average of just 0.3 cents. On Friday, electricity prices will briefly turn negative again: between 4:00 and 6:00 in the morning, the minimum price will be -1.7 cents.

During the weekend, prices will increase moderately but will still remain reasonable. **Saturday** sees stable average prices at 4 cents, with **Sunday** prices rising slightly higher, averaging at 4.8 cents.
