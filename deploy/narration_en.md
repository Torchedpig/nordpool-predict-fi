Currently, the Olkiluoto 1 nuclear power plant is experiencing a production shortfall. The available power is 50 MW, which corresponds to approximately 5.6 percent of its nominal output (890 MW). This production shortfall began on 22.5.2025 at 09:00 and is expected to end on 24.5.2025 at 01:00. It should be noted that the outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data during outages is limited.

The electricity prices for the coming days will show clear variations. Relatively affordable prices are expected especially during the early part of the week. On **Monday** and **Tuesday**, daily average prices will remain very low, around one cent. On Monday night and early morning hours, prices will even turn negative, reaching as low as -1.0 cents. On Tuesday, electricity prices will still stay very affordable, with an average of just 0.3 cents and reaching a minimum of -0.5 cents.

On **Saturday**, the price forecast includes somewhat greater variation. The lowest price of the day will be negative (-0.3 ¢), but the highest price spike is expected in the evening between 18:00 and 20:00, reaching approximately 4.3 cents per kilowatt-hour.

The most expensive days of the week will occur towards the end of the week: **Thursday** and **Friday**, where average electricity prices will rise noticeably. Thursday's average price will be around four cents, and during peak evening hours between 19:00 and 21:00, the price may climb close to ten cents. Thursday's price pattern is influenced by it being a public holiday, potentially reducing electricity demand compared to normal days. This may partially lower prices, although high peak prices remain possible.

**Friday** will be the most expensive day of the week. The average price will rise to six cents, and during the day, the price peak could reach as high as 14.5 cents during morning hours between 08:00 and 10:00. At this time, wind power production will be low, around 1300 MW, partially explaining this high maximum price.

On **Sunday**, prices will also be somewhat elevated, although the average price will remain relatively affordable at slightly above three cents. During Sunday morning's highest-priced hours between 07:00 and 09:00, the price could rise above eight cents, coinciding with minimal wind power production, just slightly above 200 MW.
