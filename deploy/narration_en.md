The Olkiluoto 1 nuclear power plant is currently experiencing a production shortfall. Its available capacity is only 50 MW out of the nominal 890 MW. The shortfall began on 22 May 2025 at 09:00 and is expected to end on 24 May 2025 at 01:00. Note that this shortfall may affect the accuracy of price forecasts, as training data during maintenance outages is limited.

The coming days' electricity price expectations will vary noticeably throughout the week. At the start of the week, electricity prices will remain highly affordable, but some rise in prices is expected towards the end of the week. The cheapest day will be **Monday**, when the average price remains at just 0.1 cents, with hourly prices ranging overnight from even negative -1.2 cents to slightly above one cent during daytime. Prices will also stay moderate on **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, around one cent.

Approaching the weekend, prices will gradually rise. **Thursday** is a public holiday, which might reduce electricity consumption and thus help moderate price increases, despite the day's maximum price reaching 6.4 cents. However, the highest weekly prices will occur on **Friday**, when the average daily price rises to 3.7 cents, and peak prices reach as high as 9.6 cents in the morning between 08:00 and 10:00. During this period, wind power production will also remain relatively low, partly explaining the higher prices.

Over the weekend, prices will fluctuate considerably. On **Saturday**, negative electricity prices will appear in the afternoon between 13:00 and 15:00, while morning prices reach as high as three cents. **Sunday**, meanwhile, will feature prices varying from negative levels up to 5.6 cents during morning hours between 07:00 and 09:00. Significant fluctuations in wind power production during the weekend will also contribute to these price variations.

Overall, the week will be characterized by substantial price variability, although average prices remain quite low. Negative prices are possible, especially during early-week nights and weekend afternoons. Notably, individual hourly price spikes are possible especially on both weekend days as well as Thursday and Friday, even though general price levels remain moderate.
