The cheapest days of the week will clearly be Friday and **Saturday**. On **Friday**, electricity prices will range between -1.0 and 0.6 cents, with no single hour exceeding even one cent. On Saturday, prices will drop even further, reaching a low of -1.1 ¢ in the afternoon between 14:00 and 16:00.
