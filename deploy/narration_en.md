*Electricity exchange prices will remain very low, even negative, over the weekend, but will rise significantly towards next Thursday as wind power generation weakens, pushing the average price above four cents and increasing the risk of price spikes during morning hours.*

The forecast has been updated on Thursday at 14:32.

The coming week's electricity prices will show considerable variation between days. On Friday and over the weekend, prices will remain very low, even dipping into negative figures during nighttime and afternoon hours. On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, the average price will stay around zero, occasionally even below it. Saturday's lowest prices are expected in the afternoon, roughly between 12:00 and 16:00, when prices will drop as low as minus one cent.

The same trend continues into **Monday**, although prices will rise slightly from weekend levels. Monday's average price will remain moderate at around 1.4 cents, and the day's maximum price will stay below three cents. Affordable prices at the beginning of the week are partly explained by abundant wind power generation, averaging over 4000 MW.

Price levels will increase slightly on **Tuesday**, with the day's average reaching 1.7 cents. Within the day, there will be notably more fluctuation, with prices ranging from -0.9 ¬¢ to 5.1 ¬¢. The highest prices will occur during morning hours between 8:00 and 10:00, briefly exceeding five cents.

The week's most noticeable price increase will occur on **Wednesday** and especially on **Thursday**. On Wednesday, the average price will rise to 2.5 cents, and the day's highest hourly rate will exceed seven cents during evening hours between 20:00 and 22:00. On Thursday, prices will rise even more clearly, with the day's average price forecasted at 4.5 cents. Thursday's highest prices are expected in the morning between 8:00 and 10:00, exceeding eight cents per hour. Additionally, Thursday presents an increased risk of actual price spikes, where individual hourly prices could rise above ten cents.

Thursday's elevated price level is partly explained by significantly reduced wind power output. Average wind power generation will fall below 1600 MW, clearly the lowest level of the week. This explains why Thursday's maximum prices differ notably from other days' levels.
