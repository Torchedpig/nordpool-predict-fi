Electricity prices will vary notably during the coming week. The lowest price expectations will occur on **Wednesday**, when the daily average price will stay below half a cent and the minimum price will even dip into negative territory (-1.2 ¢). Also on **Friday**, prices will remain very moderate, with the daily average below one cent and the lowest price at -0.6 ¢.

The highest prices of the week will be seen on **Monday**, with a projected daily average of 8.3 cents and a maximum hourly price potentially rising as high as 17.4 cents. Additionally, the risk of price spikes on Monday is high, meaning individual hourly prices could clearly exceed the maximum price shown in the table, potentially reaching 20–30 cents. Price spikes typically occur during morning and evening peak consumption hours, and Monday morning's most expensive hours will fall between 8:00 and 10:00.

On **Thursday**, electricity prices will again be significantly higher compared to the rest of the week. The day's average price is forecast at 6.7 cents, with a maximum price potentially rising to 17.7 cents. Thursday also carries a high risk of price spikes, with individual hourly rates possibly climbing to 20–30 cents. Thursday's highest hourly prices are currently projected for the morning hours between 8:00 and 10:00.

Weekend prices will be moderate. On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, average prices will remain below five cents, with no risk of price spikes. Saturday will briefly see prices dip into negative territory, while Sunday will remain positive throughout the day.

Wind power variability explains part of the price fluctuations. Wednesday and Friday's abundant wind generation will push prices down. Monday's and Thursday's higher prices are partly explained by lower wind production, as the minimum wind power production on these days remains below 2000 MW.
