The price of electricity on the power exchange will be volatile next week. There will be both more expensive and cheaper days.

On **Monday**, the average price of electricity will rise to a high level, 16.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. Monday's predicted maximum price is 23.7 ¢/kWh, but the prices of individual hours can rise up to 40-60 cents, especially during the evening hours between 5 PM and 7 PM. This is partly due to the low amount of wind power, which is only available at 214-1927 MW on Monday. The cold weather, -8.0 degrees Celsius, will also contribute to the price increase.

On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, the average prices will remain high, above 10 cents. Tuesday's maximum price is 16.6 ¢, and Wednesday's is 16.0 ¢. However, individual price spikes are expected on Tuesday, up to 30-50 cents per kilowatt-hour, most likely in the morning between 8 AM and 10 AM. On Wednesday, there is a similar risk in the afternoon between 3 PM and 5 PM. Wind power will be scarce on Tuesday and Wednesday, which partly explains the rise in prices. Wednesday's average temperature will drop to -9.3 degrees Celsius.

On **Thursday**, the average price of electricity is expected to settle at 10.7 cents, but the maximum price of the day may rise to 16.2 cents. The risk of price spikes still exists, and individual hours can cost up to 30-40 cents, especially in the morning between 7 AM and 9 AM. The low amount of wind power, only 754 MW at its lowest, is one reason for the price increase. Thursday's average temperature is -9.3 degrees Celsius.

Towards the end of the week, the price of electricity will turn to a clear decline. On **Friday**, the average price will drop to 3.3 cents, and on the weekend days, the prices will be very cheap. Friday's highest price is only 5.1 ¢/kWh.

On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, electricity will be very cheap. Saturday's average price will fall to 1.2 cents, and during the dark hours of the night, the price will even dip to -0.2 cents. Sunday's average price is 1.5 ¢. During the weekend, there will be plenty of wind power available, which partly explains the low prices.
