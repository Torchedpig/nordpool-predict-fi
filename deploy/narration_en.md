The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently in maintenance outage. Its availability is 0.0 percent and available capacity 0 MW. The maintenance outage started on 1.3.2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on 2.5.2025 at 02:00. The outage may affect the accuracy of forecasts as there is limited training data available during maintenance periods.

Electricity prices for the upcoming week will be variable. Prices are expected to peak on **Monday**, when the daily average price rises to 9.3 cents and the highest prices are expected in the morning between 8–10 and again in the evening between 20–22. Additionally, there is a high risk of short-lived price spikes on Monday, potentially pushing hourly prices even up to 20–40 cents.

**Tuesday** will also be slightly more expensive than usual, with a daily average of 6.9 cents. Possible price spikes might occur especially during the morning hours between 8–10. These spikes could momentarily lift electricity prices up to 20–30 cents. Tuesday's higher prices can partly be explained by low wind power production during morning hours.

The cheapest days of the week will be **Wednesday** and **Saturday**, with average prices below one cent. Wednesday's prices are expected to remain very low throughout the day, and overnight prices will dip into negative figures. On Saturday, the week's lowest hourly price occurs during the afternoon between 13–15, dropping electricity price as low as -2.1 cents per kilowatt-hour. Sunday also offers moderate pricing, with an average price of 1.6 cents and the possibility of briefly negative prices early in the morning.

On **Thursday** and **Friday**, prices will return to moderate levels with daily averages around four cents. However, Friday has a small risk of a price spike particularly in the evening between 20–22, potentially raising momentary prices to around ten cents per kilowatt-hour.

Throughout the week, prices will clearly fluctuate from one day to another. The largest variations are mainly explained by significant changes in wind power production on different days and hours. The forecast also includes individual negative prices occurring on several nights and during the weekend. Electricity users should pay special attention to hourly price developments on Monday and Tuesday to avoid the highest prices.
