*Electricity prices in the coming days will mostly remain affordable, although temporary price spikes may occur on Friday and Thursday evenings; the maintenance break at the Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant continues, potentially affecting forecast accuracy.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance break, which started on 1 March 2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on 2 May 2025 at 02:00. This maintenance break may affect the accuracy of the price forecast due to limited training data available from maintenance periods.

Forecast updated on Thursday at 12:00.

During the coming week, electricity prices will remain at affordable levels. However, noticeable differences between days can be seen in both prices and wind power generation. On average, daily prices will range from 1.0 to 3.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. The cheapest days are expected to be **Saturday** and **Sunday**, when average prices will remain clearly below two cents. **Friday** is expected to be the most expensive, with an average price of 3.4 cents.

On Friday, electricity prices will fluctuate significantly within the day. The cheapest hours will occur during early morning (04:00–06:00), with prices dropping even below zero (-0.4 ¢). The most expensive hours will fall between 20:00 and 22:00, when prices may rise above 11 cents. During this period, there is a risk of price spikes, potentially raising prices momentarily even above 20 cents per kilowatt-hour.

On Saturday, prices will remain stable and low throughout the day, varying between -0.4 and 3.7 cents. Strong wind power generation on Saturday partly explains these low prices. On Sunday, prices will also remain low, but greater variations are expected during the day. Prices on Sunday evening and night hours will drop below zero.

On Monday and Tuesday, prices will slightly rise but still remain affordable. Tuesday's average price will be slightly higher, around 3.3 ¢, though no risk of price spikes has been forecasted. On Wednesday, prices will return to lower levels again.

On Thursday, electricity prices will again experience some increases and fluctuations. The risk of price spikes will grow during evening hours, potentially causing prices to rise momentarily above 10 cents. This is partly due to low wind power generation, with minimum output occasionally dropping below 2000 megawatts.

Overall, the week will mostly offer moderate electricity prices, but hourly price fluctuations may at times be significant, especially in the evenings of Friday and Thursday.
