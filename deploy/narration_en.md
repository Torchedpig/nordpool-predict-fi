Electricity price expectations will vary significantly in the coming days. There will be both cheap and more expensive days.

On **Sunday**, the average price of electricity will remain very affordable, at only 1.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. The price will be at its lowest only 0.1 cents, and at its highest only 3.9 cents. On Sunday, there will be plenty of wind power available, which explains the low price level.

On **Monday**, the price will rise, but will still remain at a reasonable level. The average price for the day is expected to be 5.4 ¢/kWh. At night, the price will temporarily fall to -0.1 cents, but will rise during the day to a maximum of 9.5 cents. There will still be quite a lot of wind power, but less than on Sunday.

Next **Tuesday** will be very similar to Monday. The average price of electricity will be 5.3 ¢, and the price will vary between 1.5 cents and 9.8 cents. The amount of wind power will decrease slightly from Monday.

On **Wednesday**, the price will rise slightly from Tuesday. The average price is expected to be 6.7 ¢/kWh. The highest price of the day will rise to 10.4 cents, but at its lowest, the price will be only 2.5 ¢.

Next **Thursday** will be the clearly most expensive day of the week. The average price will rise to 10.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, and the intraday variation will be large. At its lowest, the price will be 5.6 ¢, but at its highest, as much as 17.8 ¢. Wind power production will decrease significantly on Thursday, which partly explains the price increase. In addition, there is a risk that price spikes will be experienced during individual hours, when the price of electricity could temporarily rise to as much as 30-40 cents per kilowatt-hour. The price spikes would most likely occur between 5 PM and 7 PM.

On **Friday**, the price will fall again, and the average price is expected to be 5.9 ¢/kWh. The price will remain between 3.2 and 8.3 cents. There will be plenty of wind power available on Friday, which will help keep the price reasonable. Friday will also be the coldest day of the week, at -5.6 degrees Celsius.

Next **Saturday**, the price of electricity will continue to fall. The average price will be 5.2 ¢/kWh, and the price will vary between 2.7 and 7.1 cents. Saturday will be the coldest of the week, at -7.6 degrees Celsius, but wind power will be readily available, which will balance the price.
