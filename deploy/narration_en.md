*Electricity prices in the coming days will fluctuate significantly, ranging from negative nighttime rates to evening peaks exceeding 20 cents; risks of price spikes exist, especially due to low wind production, and the maintenance outage at Olkiluoto 3 may affect forecast accuracy.*

Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage. The outage began on 1 March 2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on 2 May 2025 at 02:00. This maintenance period may affect forecast accuracy, as training data during outages is limited.

Forecast updated on Wednesday at 21:01:

Electricity prices will vary notably from day to day during the week. The lowest prices will occur on **Sunday** and **Friday**, when average daily prices remain below four cents. On **Sunday**, prices will even dip into negative territory, especially between 03:00 and 05:00, with the lowest forecasted price reaching -2,4 cents per kilowatt-hour.

The week's highest price levels will occur on **Thursday**, when the daily average will rise to 9,9 cents, and peak prices will climb to nearly 23 cents between 19:00 and 21:00. Prices will also rise notably on **Tuesday**, with an average daily price around nine cents and a maximum price of 13 cents between 08:00 and 10:00. On both days, low wind power production during morning and daytime hours partly explains these elevated prices.

Several days carry a specific risk of price spikes. On **Friday**, **Saturday**, **Monday**, and **Tuesday**, individual hourly prices may exceed the current forecasts. Particularly on **Saturday**, when minimum wind power production falls exceptionally low (360 MW), the risk of high momentary prices increases. On Saturday, price spikes might reach as high as 10‚Äì20 cents, especially between 08:00 and 10:00. On **Monday** and **Tuesday**, individual hourly prices could also rise up to 20 cents, mainly during morning and evening peak consumption periods.

Due to significant price variations throughout the week, electricity users should anticipate that the cheapest hours often occur overnight or very early in the morning. Particularly during the weekend, prices will occasionally turn negative, providing opportunities for exceptionally economical electricity use.
