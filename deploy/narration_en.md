*The upcoming week's electricity price forecast shows significant price fluctuations and occasional high price peaks at the beginning of the week, but from midweek onwards, prices will drop exceptionally low and occasionally even negative, particularly due to strong wind power production.*

Olkiluoto 1 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage. The outage started on 11 May 2025 at 18:00 and is estimated to end on 22 May 2025 at 18:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data from periods of outages is limited.

The coming week will bring varied electricity prices. Average daily prices are expected to remain moderate overall, with no exceptionally high daily averages anticipated. However, substantial price differences will occur between different days and hours within the week.

The highest single price peak of the week will occur on **Monday** morning. Prices will reach as high as 15.8 cents during approximately 7‚Äì9 a.m. This peak is primarily due to very low wind power production, dropping to its minimum level of 142 megawatts during the morning hours. Outside these hours, Monday's prices will remain significantly lower.

**Tuesday** will also experience considerable price variability. During the day, prices will fluctuate between 1.1 and 13.3 cents. On Tuesday, there is a high risk of price spikes, especially in the morning hours around 8‚Äì10 a.m., when wind power production temporarily falls below 1400 megawatts.

Prices will decrease significantly in the middle of the week. On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, average prices will drop below one cent per kilowatt hour. Negative prices will also occur during nighttime hours on both days. The lowest prices will be experienced on Thursday night around 2‚Äì5 a.m., when electricity prices will dip as low as -1.5 cents per kilowatt hour. Strong wind power production contributes to these low prices.

On **Friday**, prices will continue to remain low, averaging around one cent. **Saturday** will offer especially affordable electricity, with the day's average price turning negative at -0.4 cents per kilowatt hour. Sunday's average price will return slightly positive at 0.6 cents, and the day will include moderate price fluctuations, including negative prices during daytime and higher prices in the evening around 10 p.m. to midnight.

Overall, during the upcoming week consumers can anticipate notably affordable electricity prices from midweek through the weekend. Only at the start of the week, on Monday and Tuesday mornings, should consumers be prepared for higher hourly prices.
