On Tuesday and Wednesday, the average price of exchange electricity will settle around 1.1-1.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. On the night before Tuesday, the price will even fall to negative. On Wednesday, very similar figures will continue, and the price will again be on the negative side on the night before Wednesday.

On Thursday, the price will rise slightly, to about 2.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. As the weekend approaches, prices will continue to rise. The average price for Friday is predicted to be 6.0 cents, and the highest price of the day could rise up to 11 cents per kilowatt-hour.

On Saturday, the price will fall again, and the average price will be 2.4 cents. On Sunday, the average price will rise to 3.8 cents.

Next Monday, the average price of exchange electricity will rise significantly, to about 9.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. A high risk of price spikes is also predicted for Monday, with prices for individual hours potentially rising to 20-40 cents. The risk of price spikes is particularly associated with the morning and evening hours. For example, on Monday morning between 7-9 AM, the price may rise high, as according to the forecast, only a little wind power will be available.
