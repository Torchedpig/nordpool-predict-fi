The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage. The outage began on 1.3.2025 at 03:00, and the estimated end time is 2.5.2025 at 02:00. The outage may affect the accuracy of the forecast, since training data during maintenance periods is limited.

Electricity market prices will vary significantly over the next days. The cheapest day of the week will be **Sunday**, when the average electricity price stays close to zero, more precisely at 0,1 cents per kilowatt-hour. Negative hourly prices will also occur on Sunday, with prices falling as low as -2,1 cents. The day's highest price will remain low, at only 4,3 cents.

**Thursday** will also be exceptionally affordable, with an average price of 1,3 cents. On Thursday, hourly electricity prices will range from -0,2 to 3,2 cents, without any risk of price spikes.

The highest daily average electricity price will occur on **Tuesday**, when the average price rises to 6,3 cents per kilowatt-hour. Tuesday's maximum price will peak in the morning between 7â€“9 at almost 12 cents, and the risk of price spikes will be notably elevated. On individual hours, the price could rise as high as 20 cents.

On **Saturday** and **Monday**, price levels will be moderate, but the risk of price spikes will be elevated on these days as well. On Saturday, the daily average price will be 5 cents and the maximum price 9,4 cents, although individual hourly prices may rise as high as 10 cents. Saturday's price increases will partly be explained by low wind power production, which at times will drop to just 463 megawatts. On Monday, the average price will be 3,4 cents and the maximum price 7,3 cents, but again price spikes could push individual hourly prices towards around 10 cents.

On **Friday**, the average price will be 3 cents, but significant intraday variation will occur. During the cheapest hours at night, electricity will cost only 0,4 cents, but in the evening between 21â€“23, prices will surge above 12 cents. Friday evening's elevated prices will be partly explained by low wind power production, dropping as low as 720 megawatts.

It will be particularly worthwhile to follow price variations on Tuesday and Friday, when careful timing of electricity usage may significantly affect electricity bills.
