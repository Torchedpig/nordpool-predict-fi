*Electricity exchange prices for the coming days will mostly stay low, although brief price peaks can occur, particularly on Tuesday morning. The most affordable hours fall on Thursday, thanks to strong wind power generation, while the week's highest prices occur during periods when wind power availability is lowest.*

The Olkiluoto 1 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The outage began on 11 May 2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 22 May 2025 at 18:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of price forecasts, as training data during outages is limited.

Forecast updated on Tuesday at 09:07.

In the forecast for the coming days, electricity prices will remain generally low. Average daily electricity prices will vary between -0.8 and 2.2 cents per kilowatt-hour throughout the week.

**Thursday** will emerge as the most affordable day of the week, with average prices dropping to -0.8 cents. On Thursday, even the day's highest price will remain moderate, slightly above one cent. This affordability is largely due to substantial wind power generation, consistently high throughout the day, never dropping below 3389 MW.

In contrast, **Tuesday** stands out as the week's most expensive day. Tuesday's average price will rise to 2.2 cents, and the highest price is expected to peak at 8.7 cents in the morning between 8:00 and 10:00. The Tuesday morning price spike is largely explained by exceptionally low wind power generation, briefly falling below 1300 MW.

Brief price peaks are also expected on **Friday** and **Sunday**. Friday's maximum price of 5.1 cents will occur in the morning between 7:00 and 9:00. On Sunday, the highest price, 4.3 cents, is forecast for late morning between 8:00 and 10:00. On both days, the minimum wind power production will be notably low, temporarily driving up electricity prices.

On other days, prices will predominantly remain negative or close to zero, especially during nighttime hours. Average prices on Wednesday and Saturday will remain slightly negative, meaning electricity prices will be below zero cents on average during these days.

Overall, the weekly outlook indicates that electricity prices will remain very affordable, although brief price peaks are expected on a few mornings. Users should particularly note the higher prices forecast for Tuesday morning.
