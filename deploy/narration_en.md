During the upcoming week, electricity prices will fluctuate notably from day to day. The highest daily average price will occur on **Wednesday**, with an expected average of 19.5 cents. Wednesday will also experience significant price variability, ranging from a low of 9.5 cents to a peak of up to 37.3 cents. The week's highest prices will be seen in the morning hours between 6‚Äì8 am on Wednesday, when electricity prices will exceed 32 cents.

**Thursday** will be a public holiday, typically lowering electricity demand and thus prices. Thursday's average price will therefore be considerably lower than Wednesday's, around 5.8 cents. However, there will be a high risk of price spikes on individual hours. While the forecasted maximum price for Thursday is 11.2 cents, prices could rise as high as 20‚Äì30 cents during some hours.

The week's cheapest days will be **Friday** and **Saturday**, when the average electricity price will remain below two cents. On Friday, prices will range only between 0.6 and 2.7 cents according to forecasts. Saturday's price level will be similarly low, averaging 1.7 cents, with fluctuations between 0.3 and 2.9 cents. The low weekend prices are due to strong winds: wind power production will average nearly 4,900 megawatts on Friday and remain over 3,500 megawatts on Saturday.

On **Sunday**, prices will remain moderate, albeit slightly higher than the weekend's lowest levels. Sunday's expected average is two cents, and price fluctuations will stay modest.

At the start of next week, prices will rise again. **Monday's** average price will increase to 5.6 cents, with the highest prices appearing around 8‚Äì10 am, when the price will exceed 10 cents. On **Tuesday**, the average price will climb further to around 6.8 cents, with the risk of price spikes returning. Although the forecasted maximum price for Tuesday is 13.7 cents, individual hours could see prices rise as high as 20 cents.
