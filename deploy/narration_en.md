On Tuesday and Thursday, electricity prices are expected to rise significantly at times. On **Tuesday**, prices are forecasted to peak between 19:00–21:00, when prices could exceed 13 cents per kilowatt-hour. The risk of price spikes on Tuesday is high, and prices for individual hours might reach as high as 10–20 cents. Wind power generation on Tuesday is at times quite low, dropping as low as 587 MW, partially explaining these higher price spikes.

**Wednesday's** price level will be notably lower, with the daily average remaining below three cents. Price variation on Wednesday is moderate, and no price spikes are expected.

On Thursday, the average electricity price will again climb higher, reaching around four cents. The risk of price spikes on Thursday is significant, potentially pushing prices as high as 10–20 cents per kilowatt-hour. Thursday's highest forecasted price, around 10 ¢, occurs during the morning hours between 09:00–11:00. Wind power generation on Thursday is relatively low on average, contributing to these higher price spikes.

Friday, which is a public holiday, sees the week's lowest average electricity price, around one cent. Price variation on Friday is minimal. Wind power is abundant, supporting the low price level. No risk of price spikes is expected for Friday.

The weekend begins on **Saturday** with very affordable electricity prices, averaging below one cent. Saturday's price variation is also quite moderate. On Sunday, electricity prices will rise slightly above the weekend's levels, with an average price slightly above two cents. Sunday, also a public holiday, carries a risk of price spikes, with individual peak prices potentially reaching around 10 cents. This risk is linked to Sunday's low minimum wind power, which at times falls below one thousand megawatts.

On Monday, the average electricity price will rise slightly above three cents. Monday is also a public holiday, and there is a risk that price spikes could reach up to around ten cents.
