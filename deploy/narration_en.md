During the upcoming week, electricity prices will vary significantly. Prices early in the week will be volatile, but average prices will decrease clearly towards the weekend.

The highest prices of the week will occur on **Monday**, with significant hourly variations. The most expensive hours will be around 8–10 a.m., when the price is expected to reach between 15 and 17 cents per kilowatt-hour. Additionally, there is a notable risk for price spikes on Monday, potentially raising the price of individual hours by as much as 20–30 cents above the forecasted maximum. This is partly explained by the day's minimum wind power production being relatively low, around 800 MW, which drives prices up.

On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, prices will clearly drop compared to Monday. On Tuesday, prices will remain moderate, with an average price around 3.6 cents. On Wednesday morning between 8–9 a.m., prices will briefly exceed 10 cents, but the day's average price remains affordable at about 3.4 cents. However, both days carry a slight risk of short price spikes, potentially pushing individual hourly prices as high as 10 cents above the forecasted levels.

On **Thursday**, the price level will continue declining, and the day is a public holiday. Reduced electricity demand during the holiday may further lower prices, resulting in an average price of about 1.6 cents. Thursday will see the week's last peaks above six cents around 8–10 a.m.

On **Friday**, **Saturday**, and **Sunday**, electricity prices will drop significantly, reaching exceptionally low levels. Over the weekend, electricity prices will even dip into negative territory, especially during the nights leading to Saturday and Sunday. The lowest price on Saturday will reach as low as negative one cent, while Sunday’s lowest price will be -0.7 cents. The average daily prices on these days will remain clearly below one cent, making the weekend's price levels exceptionally affordable.
