Next week, the price expectations for exchange electricity will vary considerably. The beginning of the week looks very affordable, but towards the end of the week, average prices will rise. **Sunday**, in particular, stands out as a clearly more expensive day. Sunday's average price, 6.6 ¢/kWh, is many times higher than other days. The maximum price on Sunday may rise to 11.7 cents per kilowatt-hour.

The price development next week will be characterized by large differences between the days. During **Monday** and **Tuesday**, the price of electricity may even go below zero. The average price for Monday is expected to be 0.5 ¢ and for Tuesday 0.7 ¢. On Wednesday, the average price will rise to 1.5 cents. As we move towards the end of the week, average prices will continue to rise.

The average prices for **Thursday** and **Friday** will settle around 2.0 and 2.1 cents. On Saturday, the average price will already be 2.8 ¢. On Sunday, wind power is predicted to be low, averaging 2326 MW. The scarcity of wind power on Sunday partly explains the high price of the day. On Sunday, price spikes of up to 20 cents are expected during individual hours.

In addition to Sunday, **Saturday** also contributes to the rise in prices over the weekend. On Saturday, the price of electricity will rise from the cheap hours of the early morning towards the evening. On Saturday, the hours of the afternoon and early evening may be more expensive. Saturday's highest price, 5.4 ¢, will be in the early evening, around 6-8 PM.

On Sunday, the minimum wind power production will remain at only 1463 megawatts. Sunday's price spikes will likely be in the early evening, around 6-8 PM. On other days of the week, wind power will be available much more, and there is no mention of price spikes.
