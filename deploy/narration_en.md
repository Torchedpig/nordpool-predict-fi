The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage. The outage started on 1 March 2025 at 03:00 and is forecasted to end on 2 May 2025 at 02:00. This maintenance outage may impact forecast accuracy, as training data from outage periods is limited.

During the upcoming week, electricity spot prices will vary considerably from day to day. Significant intra-day differences are anticipated, with clear price peaks early in the week.

On **Friday**, prices will fluctuate sharply throughout the day. At their cheapest during early morning hours, electricity will be available for less than one cent per kilowatt-hour, whereas the most expensive hours will occur in the evening between 19:00 and 21:00, when prices will rise above 22 cents.

On **Saturday**, prices will remain low throughout the entire day, with negative prices even expected during nighttime hours. The average price for the day will remain at 1.3 cents, making it the cheapest day of the week.

On **Sunday**, prices will rise again, with a significant risk of price spikes. Individual hourly prices could reach as high as 10â€“20 cents. The highest predicted price of 10.7 Â¢ is expected during morning hours between 08:00 and 10:00. Sunday's average price will remain moderate at 3.4 cents.

At the start of the week, on **Monday** and **Tuesday**, there will again be a notable risk of price spikes. On Monday, individual hourly prices may exceed the forecasted maximum of 13.1 cents, potentially reaching around 10 cents or higher. On Tuesday, the risk of price spikes will be even greater, with peak prices potentially rising significantly above the forecasted maximum, up to 20â€“30 cents. Tuesday's forecasted average price of 6.6 Â¢ will be the highest of the week.

**Wednesday** and **Thursday**, however, will have considerably more moderate price levels. On Wednesday, prices will even become negative during nighttime hours, and the daily average will remain below two cents. Thursday's prices will be slightly higher but will still remain moderate.
