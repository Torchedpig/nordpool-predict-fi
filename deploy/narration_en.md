Significant variations are expected in electricity prices in the coming week. The weekend will begin on **Saturday** with relatively high hourly prices, peaking at 16.6 cents in the evening between 19:00 and 21:00. However, the day's average price will remain moderate at 6.6 cents. On **Sunday**, the situation will change noticeably, with the day's average expected to drop significantly to around 1.7 cents. Early Sunday morning will even see negative hourly prices, with the lowest at -0.3 cents from 03:00 to 05:00. Sunday is a public holiday, reducing energy consumption and influencing prices. Despite the day's overall low price level, there is still a risk of price spikes on individual hours on Sunday, potentially reaching up to 10 cents.

The new week will begin on **Monday** still favorably priced, with an average below four cents. This day is also a public holiday, further reducing electricity demand. Nevertheless, Monday also carries a risk for individual price spikes, which may rise up to 10 cents.

The week's highest prices will occur on **Tuesday**, when the average price will rise above eight cents. Tuesday's highest hourly price is forecast at 15.4 cents in the evening hours between 19:00 and 21:00. Additionally, there is a high risk of significant price spikes on Tuesday, potentially reaching as much as 20–30 cents for individual hours. The low wind power production on the same day partly explains the elevated price.

On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, electricity prices will remain clearly higher, around eight cents on average. Wednesday's highest hourly price, 13.7 cents, will occur in the morning hours between 07:00 and 09:00. On Thursday, the highest price is slightly higher (14.6 cents), occurring in the morning between 07:00 and 09:00. Both days carry a risk of price spikes, potentially elevating individual hourly prices up to 20–30 cents.

The week will conclude on **Friday** with a return to low price levels: the day's average price will be only 1.7 cents, with no risk of price spikes. Price fluctuations on Friday will be moderate, with prices remaining below four cents at their highest.
