The electricity price forecast for the coming days shows clear variation. **Thursday**, **Friday**, and **Saturday** are expected to be affordable days, with average electricity prices around one cent. Negative minimum prices will also occur during these days, particularly at night and in the afternoon hours.

The price level will rise notably on **Sunday**, when the average price is expected to reach 5.2 cents. Peak hourly prices might rise as high as 20 cents. This increase is partly explained by the low wind power production, averaging only around 1500 MW for the day.

The price rise continues on **Monday**, when the average price will climb to 7.0 cents. Significant hourly differences occur within the day: prices peak in the morning hours between 8:00–10:00, possibly exceeding 16 cents according to forecasts. There is a significant risk of price spikes, and hourly prices may rise as high as 20–30 cents during individual hours.

On **Tuesday**, the price level will drop again significantly, averaging at around 1.5 cents. Negative minimum prices are also expected early Tuesday morning.

Next **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, average prices will rise again, to 7.5 cents on Wednesday and 11.8 cents on Thursday. On Wednesday, the risk of price spikes is high again, and prices might reach 20–30 cents, especially in the evening around 20:00–22:00. Thursday also carries a significant risk of price spikes, with individual hourly prices potentially rising as high as 30 cents.

During the week, several negative minimum prices will occur, particularly at night, indicating periods of high electricity production or low consumption. It is advisable to closely monitor the price developments from Sunday onward, as after a favorable start to the week, prices are expected to rise markedly.
