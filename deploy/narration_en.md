The price of exchange electricity will be mostly affordable next week. The coming week will be variable in price, but will mostly remain at affordable levels. The most expensive day will be **Monday**, when the average price of exchange electricity is expected to be 4.0 ¢/kWh, and the highest price of the day may rise to 10.0 cents per kilowatt-hour.

On other days, the average price will remain well below 4.0 cents. The cheapest days will be **Sunday** (0.4 ¢/kWh), **Tuesday** (0.7 ¢/kWh) and **Saturday** (0.5 ¢/kWh). On Sunday and Tuesday, the price will even fall into negative territory. On Sunday, the lowest price of the day will be -1.9 ¢ and on Tuesday -0.4 ¢. On Saturday, the lowest price of electricity will be -1.3 ¢/kWh.

The higher price on Monday is partly explained by the fact that less wind power will be available than on other days. The minimum wind power production on Monday will remain at 2095 megawatts, while on other days the minimum production is clearly higher.

During the week, there will be several days when the price of electricity falls into negative territory. On Sunday, negative prices are expected for the afternoon hours around 2-4 PM. On Tuesday, negative prices may occur from 4 PM onwards. On Wednesday, the price will fall into negative territory during the early morning hours, and on Saturday, negative prices are expected for the afternoon and early evening hours, around 1-7 PM.
