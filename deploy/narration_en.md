During the upcoming week, the electricity market price is expected to remain at a moderate level. The most affordable day of the week is anticipated to be Sunday, when the average price is forecast to stay at 1.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. Sunday will also see the only negative hourly price of the week, occurring in the afternoon hours. The impact of the public holiday is clearly visible in the electricity market, as demand is expected to be lower than usual throughout the day.

The highest expected price peak of the week falls on Monday evening between 20:00 and 22:00, when the price is projected to momentarily reach 10.7 cents. This is due to exceptionally low wind power production during the evening hours, dropping to the day's minimum of 1000 megawatts at the time of the peak price. On other weekdays, wind power remains below 2500 megawatts, which also raises average prices, especially on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.

In the middle of the week, from Tuesday to Thursday, the market price is expected to stay between three and four cents on average. On these days, there is also a risk of individual price spikes, when the price could momentarily rise up to 10 cents per kilowatt-hour. Such peaks typically occur in the morning or evening, for example, on Tuesday between 8:00 and 10:00 and on Wednesday between 20:00 and 22:00.

On Friday, the average electricity price will climb to the highest of the week at 4.3 cents, as wind power production remains among the lowest for the week. On Saturday, the price level will remain similar, but the risk of higher hourly prices is present, especially in the evening.

For nuclear power, the Loviisa 2 plant will have a production shortfall from 4 May 2025 at 17:00 to 6 May 2025 at 20:00. Such an outage may affect forecast accuracy, as training data from outage periods is limited.
