Exchange electricity price expectations will vary during the coming week. The most expensive days will be **Sunday** and Monday. Sunday's average price will rise to 13 cents per kilowatt-hour, and the highest price of the day will climb close to 20 cents. Monday's average price is only slightly lower, 12.5 ¬¢, but the maximum price of the day can rise up to 22.2 cents.

Both days, Sunday and Monday, include a high risk of price spikes of up to 30-50 cents for individual hours. On Sunday, there is very little wind power available, only 293-915 MW, which partly explains the high price level. On Monday, wind power is forecast to increase, but the intraday variation is large, and at its lowest, wind power is available only 314 MW. Monday's price peak is likely to be in the early evening, around 5-7 PM.

High prices are also expected on **Tuesday** and Wednesday. Tuesday's average price is forecast at 11.3 ¬¢ and Wednesday's at 10.5 ¬¢. Tuesday's highest price may be 18.1 ¬¢, and Tuesday also includes a high risk of a price spike of up to 40 cents. Tuesday's price peak will probably be in the evening, around 6-8 PM. On **Wednesday**, the highest forecast price is 14.9 ¬¢, and Wednesday also includes a high risk of a price spike of up to 40 cents in the morning hours, around 8-10 AM.

After Wednesday, the price level will fall significantly. **Thursday**'s average price is 9.0 ¬¢, but due to the low amount of wind power, the maximum price of the day will rise to 13.7 cents. It should be noted for Thursday that the prices of individual hours may rise up to 20 cents higher than forecast.

Towards the end of the week, the price of electricity will settle at a clearly lower level. **Friday**'s average price is expected to be 5.3 ¬¢ and **Saturday**'s 5.1 ¬¢. On Friday, there will be plenty of wind power available, up to 2440-4426 MW, which will push the price down. During Friday and Saturday, the price will fall to its lowest, even below two cents.

The average temperature for the whole week will remain below freezing, so the need for heating will increase electricity consumption and may thus partly affect the price level.
