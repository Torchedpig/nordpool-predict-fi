*Electricity prices will fluctuate significantly in the coming days: prices will drop into negative territory over the weekend thanks to abundant wind power, but by mid-next week, limited wind and high risk of price spikes will drive prices significantly higher.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The maintenance started on 1 March 2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on 2 May 2025 at 02:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as training data from similar situations is limited.

Forecast updated on Thursday at 09:00.

In the upcoming weekend, electricity prices will decrease significantly. On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, negative hourly prices are even expected. The cheapest hours of the week will occur on **Saturday** between 12:00 and 14:00, when the price will drop to -1.6 cents. On **Sunday** afternoon between 13:00 and 15:00, prices will also be very low, reaching -2.2 Â¢ at the lowest.

Thus, the weekend days will be the most affordable of the week, with average prices negative or close to zero. Such price levels in the electricity market are primarily due to exceptionally high wind power production, which will keep prices low. On **Saturday**, average wind power will be 5649 MW, and on **Sunday**, 5035 MWâ€”both unusually high levels.

However, the situation will change rapidly as the week progresses. Already on **Wednesday**, the average electricity price will rise to 8.9 cents, with the day's peak reaching 15.1 Â¢ between 8:00 and 10:00. The risk of sudden price spikes on this day will be high, with individual hourly prices potentially rising as high as 20â€“40 cents. This is largely due to the drop in wind power production, which will average only 1564 MW on Wednesday.

The highest prices of the week will occur on **Thursday**, with an average price expected at 11.7 Â¢. Thursday's most expensive hour is forecasted in the evening between 19:00 and 21:00, when prices will reach 19.8 cents. The risk of price spikes will be extremely high on Thursday as well, with hourly prices potentially reaching 30â€“50 cents. This will be driven especially by very low wind power production, averaging only 1424 MW on Thursday.

Significant price variations will also occur on **Friday**. Although the average price level is forecasted at 9.3 cents, hourly prices during the day will range widely between 0.9 and 16.4 Â¢. The risk of price spikes on Friday will also be high, with potential short-term price increases up to 20â€“40 cents. A contributing factor to this is the minimum wind power production dropping down to just 264 MW on Friday.
