Significant price fluctuations are expected in electricity prices at the end of the week. **Thursday** stands out as the most expensive day, with an average price rising to 12.8¢ and a maximum of up to 19.0¢. During this day, wind power production will remain very low especially during morning hours, which explains the higher prices. The peak price is forecast for between 8:00 and 10:00.

**Friday** is expected to see the average electricity price fall to 8.8¢. On this day, too, wind power production will remain well below one thousand megawatts throughout the day, keeping prices relatively high. The forecast also highlights a risk of individual price spikes, with electricity prices possibly surging to 20¢, for example between 8:00–10:00 or 20:00–22:00. Thus, intra-day price variation could be considerable.

**Saturday** will see prices continue to fall, with the average dropping to 5.5¢ and the minimum at 2.7¢. Saturday is also flagged for the potential of isolated high hourly prices, which could rise up to 20¢. Wind power production will be especially low early in the morning, which may accentuate short-term price peaks between 8:00–10:00 and 21:00–23:00.

**Sunday** will be the cheapest day of the week, reflected in both the average price (2.8¢) and the lowest hourly price, which may drop to 0.7¢. As this is a public holiday, demand typically decreases, supporting lower prices. Although wind power production will be significantly higher than earlier in the week, individual hourly prices may deviate from the forecast and reach up to 10¢, especially between 16:00–18:00.

Next **Monday** and **Tuesday** the price of electricity is expected to remain well below five cents, and similarly low prices are forecast for Wednesday. On these days, wind power production will approach normal levels and remain high throughout the start of the week. Nevertheless, individual hours may still see price spikes up to 10¢, especially on Monday between 9:00–11:00 and on Tuesday between 9:00–11:00 and 21:00–23:00. On Wednesday, the lowest hourly prices will dip to 0.5¢, but even then, individual hours could rise to 10¢, particularly in the evening hours.

Overall, the beginning of the week is expected to be significantly cheaper than the end. Over the weekend, average electricity prices will fall sharply as wind power production strengthens and demand decreases due to the public holiday. The highest price risk of the week is especially linked to Thursday and Friday mornings and Saturday evening, when prices may temporarily climb well above the forecast.
