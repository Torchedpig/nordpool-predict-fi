The price of electricity on the power exchange has fluctuated, and the weekend saw higher electricity prices than are expected in the coming week. On **Saturday**, the average price of electricity rose to 7.9 cents per kilowatt-hour, and during the day the price varied from 2.3 cents to 12.5 cents. On Saturday, there is also a risk of price spikes, where the prices of individual hours can rise up to 20-30 cents.

On **Sunday**, the average price fell to 4 cents, and the price remained below 10 cents throughout the day. Affordable electricity is expected for the coming week.

On **Monday** and **Tuesday**, the price of electricity will fall very low. The average price for Monday is forecast to be 2.2 cents, and on Tuesday the price will fall further to 1.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. On both days, there are also hours when the price of electricity falls below zero. On Monday, this will happen late in the evening, while on Tuesday it will happen right at the beginning of the day. On both days, wind power will be very abundant, which explains the low prices.

On **Wednesday**, the price will rise slightly, but will still remain reasonable, with an average price of 4.9 cents. On Wednesday, wind power production will fall to less than half of what it is at its peak at the beginning of the week. On **Thursday** and **Friday**, prices will continue to be stable, below five cents. Wind power will be available on Thursday and Friday significantly more than on Wednesday, but not as much as at the beginning of the week.

Although higher prices were experienced during the weekend, the coming week looks quite affordable overall. Especially the very low prices at the beginning of the week and even negative hourly prices offer consumers the opportunity to optimize their electricity consumption.
