The price forecast for exchange electricity for the coming week shows variation. Both cheaper and more expensive days are in store.

On **Monday**, the average price of electricity will rise to 13 cents per kilowatt-hour, and the intraday variation will be large: at its cheapest, electricity will cost less than 8 cents, but at its most expensive, the price will rise above 18 cents. There are also individual hours forecast for Monday when the price of electricity could rise as high as 30-50 cents. The risk of a price spike is located in the evening, around 5-7 PM. Monday's price will be driven up particularly by the forecast very low wind power production, which will remain below 600 megawatts at its lowest during the day. The severe frost, almost -8 degrees, will also contribute to the price.

On **Sunday** and next **Wednesday**, average prices will be close to 10 cents. Sunday's high price peaks could rise as high as 20-40 cents during individual hours. This is due to very low wind power production, which will remain below 600 megawatts at its lowest. The risk of a price spike is located in the evening, around 6-8 PM. For Wednesday, the risk of price spikes is located in the early evening, around 5-7 PM. Wednesday's severe frost, -9.2 degrees, will further increase the demand for electricity and raise the price.

On **Thursday**, high price peaks are expected, even 20-30 cents during single hours. The risk of price peak is during the afternoon and evening, approximately at 4-6 PM. On other days, the price of electricity is expected to settle at a more moderate level, typically fluctuating between about 3 and 13 cents per kilowatt-hour.

The cheapest hours of the week will be during the nights and early morning hours, when demand is at its lowest. Electricity will typically be most expensive in the evenings, when consumption is at its highest.
