Electricity prices will fluctuate considerably in the coming days. Early in the week, prices will rise significantly, and particularly on **Tuesday**, high hourly prices are expected. Tuesday's highest price is forecasted to be around 21,5 ¢, but there is a substantial risk of price spikes as high as 30–50 ¢ during certain morning and evening hours (especially between 19:00–21:00). This is partly due to very low wind power production in the morning, when available wind power will be only about 633 MW.

On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, electricity prices will remain high, averaging around 11 cents. Both days are forecasted to have exceptionally high maximum prices, particularly around 8:00–9:00 in the morning. On Wednesday, the peak price will be approximately 24 ¢, and on Thursday even higher, at 25,6 ¢. For both days, the risk of price spikes is considerable, and hourly prices could rise to as much as 30–40 cents.

Towards the end of the week, price levels will drop significantly. On **Friday**, the average electricity price will fall to about three cents, with no significant risk of price spikes expected. Friday's prices will remain low throughout the day, peaking at only slightly above seven cents.

During the weekend, prices will rise again slightly compared to Friday but will remain moderate. On **Saturday**, the average electricity price will be about five cents, and on Sunday around 7,6 cents. Saturday will have stronger wind power production, which helps keep prices reasonable. On Sunday, wind power production will be low, partially explaining the day's higher price and the risk of price spikes reaching 20–30 cents.

Next **Monday**, the price level will rise again close to 11 cents. Wind power production will remain low, and the maximum price may approach 20 cents. Monday also has a significant risk of price spikes, with hourly prices potentially reaching as high as 30–40 cents.
