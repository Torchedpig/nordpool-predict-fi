Exchange electricity price expectations will vary significantly over the coming week. On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, the average price of electricity is expected to be higher, while towards the end of the week prices are expected to fall significantly.

The forecast average prices for Wednesday and Thursday, 9.5 ¢ and 7.2 ¢ per kilowatt-hour, are significantly more expensive than on other days. Wednesday's maximum price, 16.9 ¢, will be higher than on other days. According to the hourly forecast, the most expensive moment is expected to be during the morning hours, around 8-10 AM. There is also a high risk of price spikes on Wednesday and Thursday, with prices for individual hours potentially rising to 20-40 cents per kilowatt-hour.

From Friday onwards, the price of electricity is expected to turn downwards. The average price for **Friday** is forecast to be 3.4 ¢, and prices will continue to fall over the weekend. On **Saturday**, the average price is expected to fall to 1.9 cents and on Sunday to 1.6 cents per kilowatt-hour.

The price of electricity is expected to be particularly cheap next **Monday**, with an average price forecast of only 0.4 ¢ per kilowatt-hour. Monday's forecast even includes negative hourly prices, as low as -0.9 ¢. This means that consumers may be paid for using electricity. Next Tuesday's average price, 5.8 ¢, will be slightly higher again.

The higher prices on Wednesday and Thursday are likely to be partly explained by the cold weather. The average temperature for Wednesday and Thursday is forecast to be -9.3 degrees Celsius. On other days, the temperature will remain around zero or slightly above freezing. In addition, the minimum wind power production on Wednesday and Thursday will remain low, which partly explains the higher prices. For example, Wednesday's minimum production is only 1140 MW.
