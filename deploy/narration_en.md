The price forecast for exchange electricity for the coming week shows varying figures. At the beginning of the week, the price of electricity will rise higher, but towards the end of the week, price expectations will fall significantly.

On **Monday**, the average price of exchange electricity is expected to be 12.8 ¬¢/kWh, and during the day the price will vary from 4.3 cents to 18.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. A risk of price spikes is also predicted for Monday, when the prices of individual hours can rise up to 30-50 cents. The most likely time for a price spike is during the morning hours, around 8-10 am. Wind power production is at its lowest on Monday morning, which partly explains the rise in prices.

On **Tuesday**, the average price of exchange electricity will settle at the level of 9.5 ¬¢/kWh. There is also a risk on Tuesday that the prices of individual hours will rise higher than expected, up to 20-40 cents per kilowatt-hour. At its cheapest, electricity will be available on Tuesday's early morning hours. The highest price of the day will be in the morning, around 9-11 am. Wind power production on Tuesday is somewhat higher than on Monday, but Tuesday still carries the risk of price spikes.

On **Wednesday**, the average price of exchange electricity is expected to be 9.4 ¬¢/kWh. Wednesday's predicted hourly prices vary from 5.9 cents to 19.4 cents. The risk of price spikes on Wednesday is similar to Tuesday, and peak prices can rise to 20-40 cents per kilowatt-hour. Wind power production on Wednesday is very variable, and during the day the production amounts vary from 462 megawatts to 4500 megawatts.

On **Thursday**, the average price of exchange electricity is expected to be 11.5 ¬¢/kWh. Thursday's hourly prices vary between 5.1 and 17.8 cents, according to the forecast. A high risk of price spikes is predicted for Thursday, and the prices of individual hours can rise up to 30-50 cents per kilowatt-hour. Price peaks are most likely to occur in the morning hours, around 7-9 am.

Towards the end of the week, the price of electricity will turn to a decline. On **Friday**, the average price is expected to be 8.5 ¬¢/kWh, and the intraday variation is between 3.3 and 16.2 cents. On Friday, the risk of price spikes still exists, and the prices of individual hours can rise to 20-30 cents per kilowatt-hour. As the weekend approaches, wind power production rises to a high level.

On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, the prices of exchange electricity will fall clearly below the week's average. The average price for Saturday is expected to be 3.4 ¬¢/kWh, and the average price for Sunday will settle at the level of 4.4 ¬¢/kWh. Saturday's cheapest hours are in the afternoon, when the price may fall to less than 2 cents. On Sunday, the price may temporarily go below one cent per kilowatt-hour.
