In the coming days, electricity prices on the exchange will vary significantly from day to day. The highest average price of the week will occur on **Wednesday**, when the average price will rise to around 7.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. On the same day, maximum prices could even exceed 16 Â¢/kWh, according to the forecast. Additionally, Wednesday has a high risk of price spikes, with individual hours potentially rising as high as 20â€“30 cents. The peak price on Wednesday is expected in the morning hours between 8 and 10 a.m.

**Sunday**, on the other hand, clearly stands out as the week's most affordable day. The average price will remain under one cent per kilowatt-hour, and negative electricity prices are forecasted during the nighttime and morning hours. Electricity prices will reach their lowest early on Sunday morning between 5 and 7 a.m., dropping to as low as -1.7 cents.

On **Thursday**, the average price will also remain moderate, at around 2.6 cents. Prices on Thursday will vary within a narrow range, and there is no risk of price spikes for that day.

During the weekend, on **Saturday**, the average price will be slightly elevated, around 6.4 cents. Saturday also has a risk of price spikes, during which prices may momentarily rise as high as 20 cents per kilowatt-hour. The highest price on Saturday is forecasted for mid-morning between 8 and 10 a.m., at approximately 10.5 cents.

On **Friday** and **Monday**, average prices will remain moderately low, but both days have a forecasted risk of price spikes. On Friday, such spikes could reach up to 10â€“20 cents at individual hours, particularly in the evening from 9 to 11 p.m. The risk on Monday is somewhat lower, reaching at most around 10 cents per hour.

The weather forecast for next week does not include unusually cold periods, so temperature will not significantly influence electricity price developments. Wind power production, however, will vary considerably from day to day, partly explaining the fluctuations in prices during the forecasted period.
