Electricity market prices will vary markedly over the coming days. The most expensive days of the week will fall on **Wednesday** and next **Monday**, with average prices around 9.5 and 9.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Wednesday morning between 7‚Äì9 am, prices might briefly rise above 16 cents, with a significant risk of even higher price spikes. During these peak-price hours on Wednesday, wind power generation will be very low, partially explaining the elevated prices.

Next Monday will also see high prices, especially in the morning between 8‚Äì10 am, when prices may exceed 17 cents. Additionally, there is a significant risk of price spikes on Monday, potentially reaching 20‚Äì40 cents per kilowatt-hour during individual hours. Wind power production on Monday is expected to be very low, contributing to these higher prices.

On **Tuesday**, prices will vary widely, dropping even into negative territory during the early morning. Electricity will be cheapest on Tuesday between 1‚Äì3 am. Similarly, prices on **Thursday**, **Friday**, and **Saturday** will remain clearly affordable, with average prices consistently below two cents. Negative prices will also occur during nighttime hours on these days.

Prices will rise again on **Sunday**, with an average daily price of around 6.8 cents. A high risk of price spikes is also forecast for Sunday, with individual hourly prices possibly reaching between 20‚Äì30 cents. This price increase will particularly occur in the evening between 7‚Äì9 pm. Wind power generation on Sunday is relatively low, further influencing the price hike.

Throughout the week, significant price fluctuations will occur. Low prices midweek and during the weekend are primarily due to abundant wind-generated electricity. Conversely, higher prices at the start of the week and on Sunday are mainly explained by low wind production and consequent price spikes.
