In the coming week, exchange electricity prices will vary considerably from day to day. The lowest-priced days will occur during the weekend, while prices will rise significantly towards the end of the week. On **Saturday**, the average price will be -0,1 cents, and even on Sunday only 0,5 cents. The lowest price on Saturday will occur between 23:00‚Äì01:00, at -1,1 cents.

The week will start on **Monday** with a moderate average price of 2,4 cents, and on **Tuesday**, prices will remain low: the average price will be 1,5 cents, with the lowest hourly rate dipping to -1,4 cents during nighttime. The early-week low prices are largely due to abundant wind power production, which significantly reduces electricity prices during these days.

The price trend will change notably from Wednesday onwards. On **Wednesday**, the average price will rise to 6,8 cents, reaching a daily peak of 11,9 cents between 18:00‚Äì20:00. Additionally, there is an increased risk of price spikes on Wednesday, with hourly prices potentially rising as high as 20 cents.

However, the most expensive day of the week will be **Thursday**, with the average electricity price climbing to 9,7 cents. Thursday's higher prices will be clearly influenced by lower wind power production, averaging only 2323 MW. Prices are expected to peak particularly high during morning and evening hours; the maximum price is forecasted to be 16,6 cents around 18:00. Furthermore, Thursday carries a significant risk of even higher hourly price spikes, potentially reaching between 20‚Äì40 cents.

The week's price fluctuations will be primarily driven by substantial changes in wind power production. Strong wind output during the weekend and early week will keep prices low, but as wind production decreases from Wednesday onwards, prices will clearly rise to higher levels.
