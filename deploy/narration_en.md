The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage. The outage began on March 1, 2025 at 03:00 and is estimated to end on May 2, 2025 at 02:00. The maintenance outage may affect forecast accuracy, as training data during outage periods is limited.

Next week's electricity price forecasts show some variation between days. The average price level will mostly remain moderate, typically below two cents. However, the early part of the week will see temporarily higher prices.

The clearly noticeable day next week will be **Tuesday**. Tuesday's expected average price is 4.1 cents, with the maximum price forecasted to rise as high as 15.5 cents between 7–9 am. Additionally, Tuesday will have an elevated risk of price spikes. Individual hourly prices could potentially rise as high as 10–20 cents. This is partly due to the week's lowest wind power output, around 1000 MW, occurring on Tuesday at around 8 am.

Similarly, on **Thursday**, electricity prices will be somewhat higher, with an average of 4.0 cents and a maximum price approaching 10 cents around 9 am. On Thursday, the average wind power production will remain at a low level, just above 2000 MW, which may increase electricity prices. Additionally, potential price spikes are forecasted for Thursday, during which prices could momentarily rise to around 10 cents.

The most affordable days of the week will be **Sunday**, **Friday**, and **Saturday**, with average prices below one cent. These days will also see negative minimum prices, particularly during night and late evening hours. For example, on Sunday evening between 9–10 pm, electricity prices will drop to -1.5 cents, the lowest single-hour price of the week. On Friday, which is a public holiday, electricity demand is expected to be lower than usual, reflected in the low prices.

Other days, such as **Monday** and **Wednesday**, will maintain relatively stable and low prices. Monday's average price will be around 1.2 cents, while Wednesday's average will remain around two cents. On these days, price fluctuations will be moderate and no significant deviations are expected.
