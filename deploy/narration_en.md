The electricity price forecast for the coming days shows clear differences between individual days. The end of the week looks very affordable, price-wise. For example, **Friday's** average price will even dip slightly negative, around zero cents, with the lowest hourly price as low as -1,4Â¢. Similarly, **Thursday**, **Saturday**, and **Sunday** feature very low electricity prices, with average daily prices just slightly above one cent per kilowatt-hour. During these days, several hours will see electricity prices become negative.

A distinct shift occurs next **Monday**, when electricity prices are expected to rise significantly. Monday's average price will climb above eight cents, with the day's forecasted peak reaching as high as 13,8 cents. Additionally, Monday has a clear risk of price spikes, with individual hourly prices potentially rising to 20â€“30 cents. Such significant price variability is at least partly explained by Monday's very low wind power generation, occasionally dipping to just over 1,000 megawatts.

On **Tuesday**, electricity prices are expected to moderate slightly from Monday's levels, yet the average price will remain notably higher compared to the weekend, around five cents. Price variations on Tuesday remain moderate, with no risk of price spikes forecasted.

Next **Wednesday's** price forecast continues to ease from Tuesday, with an average price just above three cents. However, the day's price variability is notable, as forecasted peak prices will exceed ten cents during the morning, roughly between 8:00 and 10:00. This higher-priced period may relate to morning peak consumption.

Overall, the weekend offers a period of very low electricity prices, whereas the beginning of next week brings a clear increase in prices, particularly on Monday with potential high price spikes.
