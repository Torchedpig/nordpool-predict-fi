The electricity price forecasts for the coming week will vary significantly. While the average price for the whole week will remain mostly affordable, **Friday** will clearly stand out as notably more expensive. Friday's average price is expected to be 12.1 cents, with the highest price occurring in the morning between 7:00 and 9:00, potentially reaching up to 37.6 cents.

Prices will drop significantly during the weekend. **Saturday** and **Sunday** average prices will remain well below three cents. On both days, electricity prices may occasionally become negative, especially early Saturday morning from 3:00 to 5:00 and on Sunday afternoon from 15:00 to 17:00. During these hours, consumers may momentarily benefit from negative electricity prices.

The beginning of next week will continue to offer affordable electricity. **Monday's** average price will be only 2.4 cents, with no significant price spikes expected. On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, average prices will slightly increase to 4.6 and 5.0 cents, respectively. However, peak prices on both days will remain moderate, below ten cents.

Next **Thursday** will be a public holiday, impacting electricity demand and prices. Thursday's average price will be the lowest of the week, only 1.5 cents. Individual hourly prices may again turn negative, particularly during the evening from 22:00 to 24:00. The reduced electricity consumption during the holiday partially explains these exceptionally low prices.

Although most of the week will have moderate prices, there is a risk of price spikes on several days. On Saturday, Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, individual hourly prices could experience spikes of up to 10 cents above forecasts. These potential price spikes typically occur during morning and evening hours.
