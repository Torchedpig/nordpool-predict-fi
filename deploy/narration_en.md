The price of electricity on the exchange will be variable in the coming week. Both cheap and more expensive days are in store.

On **Saturday**, the price of electricity will remain very affordable, with an average price of only 2.3 Â¢/kWh. The price will be at its lowest at less than one cent per kilowatt-hour. Very high wind power production is expected for Saturday, which explains the affordable price level.

On **Sunday**, the price will rise, but will still remain reasonable. The average price will be 6.1 Â¢/kWh. On Sunday, significantly less wind power will be available than on Saturday.

Next **Monday**, the price will rise to a more expensive level, with an average price of 10.3 Â¢/kWh. Monday's highest price, 16.1 Â¢, may occur during the least windy hours of the day. Wind power is forecast to be at its lowest at less than a thousand megawatts. There is also a high risk of price spikes on Monday, up to 30-40 cents during individual hours. The peak is most likely to occur between 7-9 am.

**Tuesday** will be the most expensive day of the week. The average price will rise to 12.1 cents per kilowatt-hour, and at its highest, the price will reach 17.3 cents. On Tuesday, too, the minimum wind power production will remain at a low level. There is also a high risk of price spikes on Tuesday, up to 30-50 cents during individual hours. The peak is most likely to occur in the morning between 7-9 am.

On **Wednesday** and Thursday, the price of electricity will remain high, with average prices above 10 cents. Wednesday's highest price could be as high as 20.1 Â¢. There is also a high risk of price spikes on Wednesday and Thursday, up to 30-40 cents during individual hours. Wednesday's peak is most likely to occur in the morning between 7-9 am, while on Thursday the peak could occur in the evening between 6-8 pm.
