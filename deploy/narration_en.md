Electricity price expectations will vary in the coming days. Electricity will be most expensive on Friday, when the average daily price rises to 9.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. The maximum price for Friday is forecast at 15.0 ¢, but individual hours may see peaks of up to 20 cents.

On **Thursday**, the average price of electricity will settle at 8.2 cents. Thursday's highest price, 15.3 ¢, will occur during the morning hours, around 8-10 AM. At that time, wind power will be scarce, at its lowest only 1762 MW. On Thursday, there is a risk that the prices of individual hours will rise to as much as 20-30 cents.

**Friday** will be the most expensive day of the week. Wind power production will remain low on Friday, which partly explains the high price of electricity. On Friday, too, there is a risk that the prices of individual hours will rise to as much as 20 cents. On **Saturday**, the price of electricity will fall slightly, but due to the low wind power, there is also a risk on Saturday that the prices of individual hours will rise as high as 20 cents. Saturday's price peak is likely to occur in the early evening, around 5-7 PM.

On **Sunday**, the price of electricity will fall to a clearly more affordable level, with an average price of 4.4 ¢. On **Monday** and **Tuesday**, electricity will be even cheaper, as wind power will be abundant. On Tuesday, the price of electricity may even temporarily fall below zero. At the beginning of next week, the price of electricity will therefore be quite affordable. Next **Wednesday**, the price will turn upwards again.
