Electricity prices are forecast to vary considerably throughout the week. The highest average price is expected on **Wednesday**, when the daily maximum could reach 20.1 cents and individual hourly spikes may climb even higher. The price peak is projected for the evening hours between 20:00 and 22:00, when wind power production is at its lowest.

On **Thursday** and **Friday**, average prices are expected to be slightly lower, at 6.4 and 6.2 cents. Weak wind power is forecast for both days, which partially accounts for the elevated prices. Both days also carry a risk of price spikes during individual hours, potentially reaching up to 20 cents. Such spikes typically occur during morning and evening hours, especially between 8:00–10:00 and 18:00–20:00.

Prices are set to decrease noticeably over the weekend. On **Saturday**, the average price drops to 4.3 cents, with maximum prices remaining moderate. Sunday is a public holiday, which means demand will be lower than usual and the average price is expected to fall to 2.2 cents—the lowest of the week. The daily maximum will also be clearly lower compared to other days. While there is some risk of price spikes on Sunday, any such spikes are likely to remain capped at 10 cents, especially around 10:00–12:00 and 18:00–20:00.

Next **Monday** and **Tuesday** will see prices rise slightly from the weekend lows, but still remain below a five-cent average. Both days come with a moderate risk of hourly price spikes, with prices potentially approaching 10 cents during morning and evening hours.

Overall, electricity prices are set to fluctuate markedly over the week. The highest prices are likely at the beginning of the week, particularly on Wednesday, while the weekend and Sunday will offer clearly more affordable electricity. Special attention should be paid to forecasted dips in wind power output, which elevate prices especially in the first part of the week.
