A maintenance outage is ongoing at the Olkiluoto 1 nuclear power plant. The outage began on 11 May 2025 at 18:00 and is estimated to end on 22 May 2025 at 18:00. This schedule is a forecast. The outage may affect the accuracy of the electricity price forecast, as training data during maintenance outages is limited.

Electricity prices in the coming week will display clear variations from day to day. The largest difference in price expectations will occur on **Monday**, when the day's average price will rise to 4.1 cents, and at its peak, the price could reach nearly 21 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Monday morning, between 8:00 and 10:00, electricity prices may become exceptionally high. This is largely due to the low wind power production, which will be at a minimum of only around 172 MW during morning hours.

The week's lowest electricity prices will appear over the weekend, especially on **Sunday**, when the day's average price will be negative, averaging -0.2 cents. Sunday's lowest prices will occur around midday between 11:00 and 15:00, when electricity prices drop close to minus two cents per kilowatt-hour. This is due to abundant wind power production, reaching peaks of over 4300 MW.

Also on Saturday, electricity prices will remain very low, with the daily average around half a cent. However, minor price spikes may occur during isolated hours on Saturday, even though the general price level remains low for the day.

From Tuesday to Thursday, price fluctuations will remain moderate. On these days, the average electricity price will remain around one cent or slightly below. On Tuesday and Wednesday, prices will even dip slightly negative during nighttime and early morning hours.

On Friday, the price level will rise slightly, with an average price of 3.1 cents and a maximum price reaching six cents. Nevertheless, the price level remains affordable. Throughout the week, wind power will generally be abundant, explaining the low electricity prices, particularly during nighttime.
