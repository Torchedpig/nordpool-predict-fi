The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is undergoing maintenance outage, which began on 1 March 2025 at 03:00 and is estimated to end on 2 May 2025 at 02:00. The maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as training data during outages is limited.

Electricity prices in the coming days are expected to be generally affordable, but daily differences will be significant. The most expensive day of the week will be **Monday**, when the average daily price will rise to 6,7 cents and the maximum price will reach a level of 15,4 ¬¢. Additionally, Monday carries a high risk of price spikes according to forecasting models. Hourly prices could rise even to 20‚Äì30 cents, especially in the morning between 8‚Äì10 o'clock, when the forecasted maximum price is highest.

On **Thursday**, electricity price fluctuations will also be noticeable. Thursday's average price will be 4,8 ¬¢, but the maximum price will rise as high as 18,1 cents between 8‚Äì10 in the morning. Thursday also has a high risk of price spikes, potentially causing hourly prices to exceed the forecasted levels, possibly reaching 10‚Äì20 cents per kilowatt-hour. Thursday‚Äôs highest prices will mainly be due to exceptionally low wind power production, dropping as low as 547 megawatts.

The cheapest days of the week will be the weekend days, **Saturday** and **Sunday**, when average electricity prices will remain low. On Saturday, the average price will be just 1,4 cents, and on Sunday even lower at 0,7 cents. On both days, electricity will occasionally have negative prices, especially on Sunday, when the lowest forecasted hourly price will be -0,7 cents.

The average prices on **Friday** and **Tuesday** will also remain moderate, each below three cents. On these days, prices will range from slightly negative values to just under ten cents. **Wednesday's** price levels will also remain reasonable, with the day's average price settling at 2,6 cents.

The large price differences between days will mainly be due to fluctuations in wind power production. According to the forecast, the highest hourly prices on Thursday and Monday are linked to notably lower wind power production during certain hours of these days.
