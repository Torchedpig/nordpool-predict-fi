The electricity price forecast for the coming week shows fluctuating price levels. At the beginning of next week, prices will remain moderate, but as the week progresses, price expectations are expected to rise.

On **Tuesday**, the average price of electricity is expected to be 5.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. During the day, the price will vary between 1.9 cents and 8.1 cents. Electricity will be at its cheapest on the night before Tuesday.

On **Wednesday**, the average price will rise slightly from Tuesday, to 6.3 ¢/kWh. However, the price will remain fairly stable throughout the day, varying from 2.2 cents to 8.8 cents.

**Thursday** will bring the highest average price of the week, 8.7 ¢/kWh. The price will peak in the afternoon and evening, with the maximum price settling at 13.9 cents per kilowatt-hour between 5 PM and 7 PM.

On **Friday**, the average price will remain at Thursday's levels, 8.2 ¢. Friday's highest price, 11.9 ¢, will be in the evening between 5 PM and 7 PM.

On the weekend (**Saturday** and **Sunday**), electricity prices will be slightly cheaper than on weekdays, but will still remain higher than average. The average price is expected to be 6.1 ¢ on Saturday and 7.0 ¢ on Sunday. On Saturday, there will be plenty of wind power available, with an average of 3653 MW. On Sunday, the frost will tighten, and the average temperature will drop to -8.8 degrees Celsius.

Next **Monday**, the price of electricity will rise significantly. The average price for the day is forecast to be as high as 14.3 ¢/kWh. A high risk of price spikes is also forecast for Monday, up to 30-60 cents for individual hours. This is partly due to the fact that wind power production is expected to be very low on Monday, at a minimum of only 744 MW. Monday's maximum price, 22.4 ¢, will be in the early evening between 5 PM and 7 PM.
