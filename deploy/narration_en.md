*Electricity market prices will fluctuate markedly in the coming week, with high weekend price peaks giving way to more moderate weekday levels. Variations in wind power production and the impact of the public holiday are especially evident in Friday's and Sunday's price forecasts.*

A maintenance outage is underway at the Loviisa 2 nuclear power plant, during which its nominal capacity of 248.0 MW is unavailable. The outage began on 4 May 2025 at 17:00 and is expected to end on 8 May 2025 at 20:00. This maintenance may affect the accuracy of the forecasts, as there is only limited training data available for such periods.

The forecast was updated on Thursday at 09:06.

At the start of the week, electricity price trends will be variable, with **Friday** expected to reach exceptionally high levels. On that day, the average price will settle at 14.1 cents, and the intraday maximum will rise to as much as 25.9 cents. This stands out from the other days, mainly due to a very low minimum wind power output, which falls to 130 megawatts. The risk of price spikes is highest during the morning and evening hours, especially between 7–9 a.m. and 6–9 p.m.

**Saturday** will see a decrease in price levels, but there will still be high values within the day, with the maximum price reaching 18.5 cents. Wind power production remains low, partly explaining the elevated prices. The risk of price spikes will be focused on Saturday morning and afternoon hours.

**Sunday** is a public holiday, reflected in lower electricity demand and prices. The average price will drop to 4.2 cents, and the lowest intraday price is forecast to briefly fall into negative territory, at -0.4 cents. Even so, individual hours—particularly late morning between 8–10 a.m. and early evening from 7–9 p.m.—may see temporary price spikes.

Moving into the beginning of the week, **Monday's** average price will remain moderate at 5.0 cents, but the maximum price during the day will reach 15.2 cents. The risk of price spikes will still be present, especially in the morning and evening hours when wind power output is at its lowest.

Next **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, electricity prices will remain significantly lower, with averages settling at 3.5 and 4.0 cents, respectively. On these days, maximum prices will remain well below 10 cents. The risk of price spikes persists for individual hours, but price fluctuations will be less pronounced than at the start of the week.

Next **Thursday**, electricity is forecast to be at its cheapest for the week, with the average price falling to 2.3 cents and only minor intraday variation. Wind power production will be at a high level, and no significant price fluctuations are expected throughout the day.
