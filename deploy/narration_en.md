The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The outage began on 1 March 2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on 27 April 2025 at 12:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data from comparable situations is limited.

Significant variability is expected in electricity prices during the coming week. The week will start with relatively high prices and will decrease notably towards the weekend. The highest prices will occur on **Monday**, when the average price will reach 6.1 cents, and hourly prices may rise as high as nearly 15 cents. Monday’s highest prices will occur in the morning between 8–10 am, when electricity prices will remain above 13 cents. Additionally, on Monday there is a high risk of sudden price spikes, potentially causing prices to rise momentarily to 20–30 cents per kWh.

On **Sunday** and **Tuesday**, electricity prices will remain at more moderate levels. Sunday’s prices will fluctuate between zero and around nine cents, while Tuesday’s prices will mostly stay below nine cents. The risk of price spikes exists on these days as well, but is significantly lower than on Monday. Average prices remain reasonable, 4.6 cents on Sunday and 4.9 cents on Tuesday.

As the week progresses, prices will continue to decline. On **Wednesday**, the average price will drop to 2.3 cents, and by Thursday, the average electricity price will fall below one cent. Thursday is a public holiday, reducing electricity consumption and thus keeping prices particularly low. During Thursday, prices will even turn negative, reaching as low as -0.7 cents during nighttime and late afternoon hours.

**Friday** will be the cheapest day of the week, with an average electricity price of just 0.1 cents. Throughout the day, electricity prices will remain very low, varying between -1.6 cents and just above one cent.

**Saturday** will also continue at a moderately low price level. The average price on Saturday will be 0.8 cents, with prices ranging between -1.0 and 3.4 cents. No significant price increases are anticipated on Saturday either, although occasional price spikes could momentarily push prices up to ten cents.
