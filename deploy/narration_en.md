Tuesday's average electricity price will be the highest of the week, around 22.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. Price fluctuations within the day will be substantial, with night-time lows around four cents. The peak price of nearly 38 cents is expected between 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning.

On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, electricity prices will also experience noticeable variations. Wednesday's average remains at 14.4 cents, but prices are forecasted to reach up to 32 cents between 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning. Thursday will see prices peak at 33.1 cents during the same morning hours. Both days have a significant risk of price spikes, potentially driving hourly prices as high as 40–60 cents.

The week's cheapest days will be **Friday** and **Saturday**, with moderate overall prices. On Friday, the average price is only 4.2 cents, dipping as low as 1.6 cents overnight. Saturday's average price remains modest at around eight cents, although prices briefly surpass 15 cents between 9:00 and 11:00 in the morning. However, there's a possibility of hourly prices rising higher than forecasted on Saturday, potentially reaching 20–30 cents.

On **Sunday** and next week's **Monday**, electricity prices will rise again slightly. Sunday's average price is just below ten cents, while Monday's average climbs to around 14 cents. Sunday also carries a risk of higher price spikes, potentially reaching 20–40 cents. On Monday, price variation remains notable, with peak prices of nearly 30 cents expected between 7:00 and 9:00 in the morning, and individual hourly price risks potentially reaching 30–50 cents.

Throughout the week, significant differences in electricity prices will occur, especially between Tuesday and Friday. These fluctuations are largely connected to variations in wind power generation, as low minimum wind output explains particularly high price peaks on Tuesday and Thursday. Consumers should therefore prepare for substantial hourly variations in electricity prices in the coming days.
