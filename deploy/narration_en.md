Electricity prices in the coming week will show noticeable variation between days. The week starts tomorrow, on **Tuesday**, with relatively low prices, averaging 3.3 cents. Particularly inexpensive electricity will be available in the early morning hours between 01:00 and 03:00, when prices even become negative, reaching as low as -1.5 cents. Prices peak in the evening between 18:00 and 20:00, reaching about ten cents.

On **Wednesday**, average electricity prices rise significantly compared to Tuesday, reaching 8.1 cents. This day will experience considerable price variation, with minimum prices dropping to 2.8 cents in the early morning, and maximum prices climbing as high as 14.5 cents in the morning between 08:00 and 10:00. Wednesday also has a high risk that prices might exceed forecasts, potentially hitting 20‚Äì30 cents at individual hours. This elevated risk is primarily due to extremely low wind power generation (only 350 MW) during the morning hours, which could significantly increase prices.

On **Thursday**, electricity prices fall notably again, with an average price of only 1.8 cents. Prices are not expected to exceed four cents at any time during the day. Occasionally, prices may even turn slightly negative around 14:00 to 15:00 in the afternoon.

Prices will remain relatively low on **Friday** and **Saturday**, with Friday's average at 2.6 cents and Saturday's at just 0.9 cents. Both days will see negative prices again, especially during nighttime hours. Saturday will offer the week's cheapest electricity.

On **Sunday**, prices rise notably again, with an average of 6.9 cents. Peak prices in the morning between 08:00 and 10:00 will reach as high as 13.2 cents. Sunday also carries a significant risk of prices exceeding forecasts, potentially rising to 20‚Äì30 cents during individual hours. Low wind power generation in the morning hours may explain this price increase.

The most expensive day of the week will be next **Monday**, when average electricity prices will rise to as high as 10.3 cents. Peak prices will reach up to 16.1 cents between 08:00 and 10:00. Wind power generation will remain very low throughout the day, which could further elevate potential price spikes beyond forecasts, possibly reaching 30‚Äì40 cents at individual hours.
