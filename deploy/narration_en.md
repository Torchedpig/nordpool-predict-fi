Price expectations for exchange electricity are mostly affordable for the coming week. Only **Friday's** average price, 7.0 ¢/kWh, will rise clearly higher than other days. The highest maximum price, 15.3 ¢, is also expected for Friday. On other days, the price will remain below 10 cents.

Wind power is forecast to be abundant during the week, which partly explains the affordable prices. Only on Friday will the average wind power production remain below 3000 megawatts, and the minimum wind power available will be only 1168 MW. This coincides with the time when the price of electricity rises to its highest. On Friday, it is advisable to prepare for the risk of price spikes: the prices of individual hours can rise up to 20-30 cents per kilowatt-hour.

The price of electricity will occasionally fall below zero. On the night before next Tuesday, hourly prices of -1.0 cents are expected for hours 00-02. Also on the night before Monday, hourly prices may fall below zero.

Friday's price spikes are forecast to occur in the evening around 6-8 PM. On other days, the price of electricity will remain moderate, and no major price fluctuations are expected if the wind power forecasts hold true.

The average temperatures of the week will remain around zero, so the temperature is not expected to significantly affect the price of electricity.
