*Electricity prices will remain mostly affordable in the coming days, but prices will notably rise early next week; the maintenance outage at Olkiluoto 3 may affect the accuracy of the forecast, and the risk of price spikes appears on Tuesday.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is undergoing a maintenance outage that started on March 1, 2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on May 2, 2025 at 02:00. This outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data from periods of maintenance outages is limited.

The forecast was updated on Tuesday at 03:14.

In the coming days, electricity prices are expected to fluctuate. However, average prices will remain affordable on most days. The highest price levels will occur early next week.

The week's most affordable days will be **Friday** and **Saturday**, when prices will remain negative for several hours. On Friday, the lowest price will reach -1.0 cents, and on Saturday it will drop even lower, to -2.2 cents. On both days, the average price will stay near zero or slightly below.

In the middle of the week, on **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, prices will remain moderate but will fluctuate slightly more. Thursday's maximum price will climb close to ten cents in the morning between 8:00‚Äì10:00. Otherwise, prices on these days will mostly remain at a few cents per kilowatt-hour.

After the weekend, prices will begin to rise. On **Monday**, the average price will reach 6.3 cents, and the maximum price will exceed 10 cents in the evening between 20:00‚Äì22:00. On **Tuesday**, prices will continue to increase, with an expected average price of 6.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. Tuesday morning between 7:00‚Äì9:00 will see the week's highest predicted price of 14.9 cents. The risk of price spikes will be significant on Tuesday, potentially causing individual hourly prices to reach up to 20 cents.

Variations in wind power generation will partly affect the price development. On windy days, particularly Friday and Saturday, electricity prices will be significantly lower. Higher price levels on Monday and Tuesday are linked to lower wind power production.
