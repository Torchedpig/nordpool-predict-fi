Exchange electricity price expectations will vary considerably over the coming week. Next **Monday**, the price of electricity is expected to remain very low, with an average price of only 0.3 ¢/kWh. Monday's hourly prices will range between zero and 0.6 cents.

Next **Tuesday**, the price will rise somewhat, but will still remain reasonable, with an average daily price of 4.7 ¢/kWh. Tuesday's peculiarity is that the price will temporarily dip slightly below zero during the night hours. Tuesday's highest price, 12.4 ¢, will be during the morning hours.

From Wednesday onwards, the price of electricity will rise to a significantly higher level. The average prices for **Wednesday**, **Thursday** and **Friday** will be around 10 cents. The predicted maximum prices for Wednesday and Thursday are also around 15-16 cents. However, the hourly forecasts show a significant risk of price spikes of up to 30-40 cents on these days. The most likely times for spikes are in the morning between 7-9 am and in the evening between 5-7 pm.

On **Saturday**, the average price will fall slightly, to 8.9 ¢/kWh. Saturday's hourly forecasts show a highest price of 15.1 ¢, but individual price spikes of up to 20-40 cents are also forecast for Saturday. The most likely times for price spikes are in the morning between 7-9 am and in the evening between 6-8 pm.

Next **Sunday**, the price will fall again, with an average price of 5.2 ¢/kWh. The highest price for Sunday is forecast at 9.0 ¢/kWh, but there is a risk of price spikes of up to 20 cents for individual hours.

The higher prices from Wednesday to Saturday are partly explained by the low level of wind power. On all these days, wind power is forecast to remain below 2500 MW of average production, and especially on Thursday, wind power will be very scarce.
