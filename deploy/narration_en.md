Tuesday's price forecast indicates an average electricity price around three cents per kilowatt-hour. Significant fluctuations are expected during the day, as prices may briefly drop into negative territory (-0,6 ¢) during early morning hours. Conversely, a clear price spike is anticipated between 19:00–21:00 in the evening, when prices could rise above 16 cents. Tuesday's high peak price is partly explained by low wind power generation (588 MW minimum), occurring precisely during these expensive evening hours.

On Wednesday, electricity prices will remain moderate, with the day's average price expected to be slightly above two cents. Price variations throughout the day will be minor, peaking around six cents between 9:00–11:00 in the morning.

Thursday is forecast to see the highest average price level of the week, around 4,6 cents per kilowatt-hour. The price variation during the day will be considerable, and the maximum price could rise close to 11 cents in the morning hours around 9:00–11:00. Additionally, there is a noted risk of individual price spikes on Thursday, potentially increasing the price by up to 10 cents higher than the forecasted maximum.

Good Friday is a public holiday, which could lead to lower-than-usual electricity demand. This is reflected in the week's lowest average price, only 0,4 cents per kilowatt-hour. Price variation will remain modest, and electricity prices could occasionally become negative during nighttime and afternoon hours.

On Saturday, electricity prices will remain low, averaging around 0,2 cents. Prices will hover near zero or negative for most of the day. Sunday prices will also stay moderate, though somewhat higher prices may occur during the day, reaching a maximum of around eight cents in the evening between 20:00–22:00. Furthermore, Sunday carries a stated risk of price spikes, potentially driving hourly prices as much as 10 cents above the forecasted maximum.

Next Monday, the price level will return slightly higher, with the day's average around 3,5 cents. Price fluctuations will remain moderate, without significantly exceeding six cents.
