Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance, which began on 1 March 2025 at 03:00. The maintenance is estimated to end on 2 May 2025 at 02:00. This maintenance break may affect the accuracy of price forecasts, as limited training data is available from periods of such outages.

Electricity prices on the exchange for the coming week are expected to be mostly affordable. However, there will be some variation between days, both in average prices and price ranges. The week's lowest average price will occur on **Wednesday**, when the expected average electricity price is only 1.1 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Wednesday, prices will dip into negative territory during the nighttime hours between 00:00 and 05:00, reaching as low as -1.5 cents at 04:00. Even at their peak, Wednesday's prices will remain moderate, only reaching 2.9 cents between 08:00 and 10:00.

On **Tuesday**, electricity prices will also be negative during several evening hours after 16:00. Tuesday's lowest hourly price, -0.6 cents, occurs just before midnight. From Tuesday to Wednesday morning, electricity prices will remain exceptionally low throughout the entire period. On both days, abundant wind power production will help keep prices down. On Tuesday, wind production will fluctuate considerably, ranging from a minimum of just 632 MW to a maximum of up to 7142 MW.

The week's highest hourly prices will occur on **Monday** and **Saturday**. Monday's peak will be in the morning, between 09:00 and 11:00, when prices will rise close to ten cents. Saturday's price spike will occur during evening hours from 18:00 to 20:00, when prices will exceed ten cents. On both days, wind power production will occasionally be relatively low, partially explaining the higher hourly prices.

Over the weekend, electricity prices on **Saturday** and **Sunday** will be variable but still moderate overall. However, for Sunday, there is a noted risk of potential price spikes, where individual hourly prices could rise as high as 10 cents, particularly in the evening. Therefore, Sunday's prices could significantly deviate from the forecast.

On other days, prices will remain relatively low and fluctuations will be modest. Thus, the overall price outlook for the week is affordable, without any significant price pressures anticipated.
