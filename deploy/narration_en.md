*This week's electricity prices will show significant variation: Wednesday will see negative prices, while Tuesday morning could experience price spikes up to 30 cents; the maintenance outage at Olkiluoto 3 may affect forecast accuracy.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance, which began on March 1, 2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on May 2, 2025 at 02:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecasts, as training data from periods of maintenance outages is limited.

The forecast was updated on Monday at 09:00.

On **Tuesday**, the week's highest average daily price is expected at 7.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. Intraday price differences will be considerable: between 08:00-10:00 in the morning, prices are expected to peak around 18 cents, with individual hours possibly experiencing price spikes ranging from 20 to 30 cents. The low minimum wind power production (708 MW) partly explains the price volatility and increases the risk of price increases, especially during the morning peak consumption period.

**Wednesday** will see the week's lowest electricity prices, averaging only 0.4 cents. Early in the morning between 02:00-06:00, prices will even become negative, reaching as low as -1.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. This situation results from very substantial wind power generation, peaking at nearly 6800 MW.

On **Thursday**, prices will rise again slightly, with an average price of 3.4 cents. Between 08:00-10:00 in the morning, the price will rise up to 15.9 cents. Additionally, certain individual hours may experience price spikes up to around 10 cents. These potential price increases are due to relatively low minimum wind power production (1070 MW), which can cause price fluctuations, particularly in the morning hours.

**Friday** and **Sunday** will both be relatively inexpensive days, each with an average price around 2 cents. Early Friday morning between 03:00-05:00, prices will dip negative, reaching as low as -0.9 cents. **Saturday** will see a slight increase, averaging 3.5 cents, with individual hours possibly experiencing price spikes up to 10 cents.

At the start of the week on **Monday**, the average price will rise to 4.7 cents. In the morning hours between 08:00-10:00, prices could peak at 10.9 cents, and price spikes during individual hours may be up to 10 cents higher than forecasted.

Overall, the week will be characterized by notable price variability between days and time periods. Particularly, low-wind periods combined with peak consumption hours will cause intermittent price increases.
