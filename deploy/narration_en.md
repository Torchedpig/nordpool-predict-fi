*Electricity prices are expected to vary significantly next week as wind power production decreases and colder weather increases demand. The risk of price spikes rises, especially on Tuesday and later in the week when prices may soar considerably.*

Next weekâ€™s electricity market is expected to show varying price trends. **Saturday** and **Sunday** are forecasted to have relatively moderate average prices of 5.1Â¢ and 6.3Â¢, with no significant price spikes. The low prices are supported by strong wind power production, keeping the rates down.

On **Monday** and **Tuesday**, average prices rise to 7.2Â¢ and 8.3Â¢. Monday carries a slight risk for price spikes, but Tuesday presents a more significant risk, with prices potentially rising to 20-30Â¢ during certain hours. This is partly due to decreasing wind power production.

From **Wednesday** onwards, electricity prices are projected to remain higher, with increased risks of price spikes. On **Wednesday**, the average price is 10.6Â¢, and spikes may occur, particularly during morning and evening hours. **Thursday** and **Friday** maintain high price levels, with average prices at 10.5Â¢ and 12.8Â¢. On Friday, there is a high risk of significant price spikes, with electricity prices potentially reaching 30-50Â¢ during some hours.

Throughout the week, price fluctuations are mainly due to varying wind power production and colder weather conditions impacting electricity demand. ðŸ”„
