*Next week's electricity price forecast shows Monday standing out with higher prices and a risk of price spikes, but as the week progresses, prices will quickly drop to very affordable levels, occasionally even negative, due to strong wind power generation.*

The Olkiluoto 1 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance, which started on 11.5.2025 at 18:00 and is scheduled to end on 22.5.2025 at 18:00. The maintenance outage may impact the accuracy of the forecast, as training data available during outages is limited.

Next week's electricity price forecast will show significant variation between days. **Monday** will stand out clearly, as the daily average price will rise to 4,2 cents and peak prices will reach up to 12,9 cents. This is mainly due to very low wind power production, averaging under 1000 megawatts throughout Monday. On Monday morning, around 8‚Äì10, there will be a high risk of price spikes, during which prices may rise even higher than forecasted.

After Monday, prices will return to lower levels. On **Tuesday**, electricity prices are expected to be very affordable, with the average price barely positive at 0,4 cents. However, there will still be a risk of individual price spikes on Tuesday, especially during the morning hours around 9‚Äì11. This is related to a temporary decrease in wind power production, which could momentarily push prices higher than anticipated.

Prices during the rest of the week will be very affordable. On **Sunday**, negative prices will even occur, dropping down to a minimum of -1,4 cents. Negative prices will also appear occasionally on **Tuesday**, **Wednesday**, **Thursday**, **Friday**, and **Saturday**. These negative prices will typically occur during nights and afternoons, when consumption is lower and wind power availability is high.

Towards the end of the week, from **Thursday** onward, prices will remain very moderate. Daily average prices will stay below one cent. This will be due to strong wind power production, clearly above normal levels from Thursday onwards, averaging over 3000 MW. Especially on **Friday**, wind power production will be abundant, reaching peak outputs exceeding 5000 MW.

Overall, next week will begin with higher electricity prices, but quickly shift to very affordable levels. Particularly from mid-week onward, electricity prices are expected to remain low, offering consumers very favorable electricity costs.
