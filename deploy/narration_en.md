Electricity prices will remain affordable over the coming days. Daily average prices are all significantly below five cents, and no particular day stands out as notably more expensive than others. However, the week's highest peaks will occur on **Wednesday** and **Saturday**, when the maximum price could reach up to 7,0 and 5,9 cents respectively.

On **Wednesday**, electricity prices will fluctuate strongly. At night, between 01:00–03:00, prices will briefly dip into negative territory, reaching -0,1 cents. The highest price will occur in the morning between 7:00–9:00, when the price rises up to 7 cents. On the same day, minimum wind power production will fall below 2000 megawatts, partly explaining the high price peak and price fluctuations.

On **Saturday**, price fluctuations will also be notable, as electricity prices will drop to negative levels as low as -1,4 cents between nighttime and afternoon hours. The day's peak price, 5,9 cents, will occur in the morning around 8:00–9:00. Likewise, wind power production will briefly fall below 2000 megawatts, contributing to the price variations and higher peaks.

The lowest daily average electricity prices of the week will be experienced on **Monday** and **Tuesday**, when average prices will remain at just 0,2 cents. On these days, prices will stay steady and briefly dip into negative values as well. The low prices can be attributed to good wind power generation, which remains at or above average levels both days.

On **Sunday**, electricity prices will also be very affordable, averaging 0,4 cents. Negative prices will occur during several hours around midday and afternoon. Price fluctuations on Sunday will be smaller than at the start of the week, though isolated price spikes could still occur.
