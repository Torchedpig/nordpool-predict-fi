Clear differences in electricity spot price expectations will be seen over the coming week. **Saturday** and **Monday** will see average prices rise above seven cents, with considerable intraday variation as well. On Monday in particular, the maximum hourly price is forecast to reach 23.7 cents, which is notably higher than on other days. On these days, wind power production also drops to unusually low levels during certain hours, which significantly raises electricity prices.

**Sunday** is expected to bring an exceptionally low average price—just 4.7 cents. This day is a public holiday, which typically reduces energy demand and affects overall price levels. Sunday’s prices will remain low, although there may be some increases during certain morning and evening hours.

Moving into the beginning of the week, **Tuesday** will offer more stable pricing, but the maximum for the day still reaches 13.2 cents, while the minimum drops as low as 0.7 cents. Wind power output increases significantly on Tuesday, helping to contain price rises particularly during midday and evening hours.

Midweek, especially on **Wednesday**, **Thursday**, and **Friday**, electricity price forecasts will fall to clearly lower levels. Wednesday’s average price will drop to 1.6 cents, and Thursday’s to just 0.8 cents. On these days, wind power production will be abundant, which is also reflected in exceptionally low minimum prices: on Wednesday and Thursday, hourly prices may even dip below zero, usually during nighttime hours. On Friday, prices are forecast to remain low as well, with no significant fluctuations expected.

The most remarkable day of the week will be Monday, when the combination of a high maximum price and low minimum wind power production stands out in otherwise declining price trends. The public holiday on Sunday will be reflected in lower price expectations and more stable intraday variation. Towards the end of the week, abundant wind power is expected to push prices sharply downward, with Thursday anticipated to be the cheapest day of the week.
