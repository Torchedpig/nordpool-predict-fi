The upcoming week presents varied electricity price forecasts. **Saturday** and **Sunday** are the most affordable days of the week, with expected average prices around 5 cents per kilowatt-hour. During these days, the amount of wind power is abundant, partially explaining the moderate prices. On **Monday** and **Tuesday**, prices are slightly higher but remain at a reasonable level. On both days, the availability of wind power is plentiful, which helps keep prices low.

Midweek sees a clear rise in prices. On **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, more expensive electricity prices are predicted, with average prices nearing or exceeding 10 cents. Wind power production decreases on these days, which may partly explain the price increase. **Wednesday** also carries a high risk of price spikes, with individual hourly prices potentially reaching 20-40 cents.

**Friday** is the most expensive day of the week, with an average price rising to 12.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. Wind power production is at a very low level, which, combined with a low average temperature, partly explains the high prices. **Friday** also presents a significant risk of price spikes, with individual hourly prices possibly reaching 30-50 cents.

Towards the end of the week, prices are expected to remain high, but fluctuations may occur. The high price days stand out particularly at the end of the week, where the risk of price spikes is significant. üå¨Ô∏è
