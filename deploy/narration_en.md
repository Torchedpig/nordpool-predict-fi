*Electricity prices this week will remain mostly affordable, but Thursday will see a notable rise compared to other days; the maintenance break at Olkiluoto 3 may affect forecast accuracy.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is undergoing a maintenance break. The break began on 1 March 2025 at 03:00 and is expected to last until 2 May 2025 at 02:00. This maintenance break may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data from maintenance periods is limited.

Forecast updated on Monday at 12:01.
