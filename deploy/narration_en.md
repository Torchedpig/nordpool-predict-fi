*Electricity prices on the power exchange will remain affordable next week, with occasional negative prices and moderate peaks; however, especially on Wednesday and during the weekend, prices may temporarily rise slightly higher due to fluctuations in wind power production.*

The Olkiluoto 1 nuclear power plant is undergoing a maintenance outage. The outage began on 11 May 2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on 22 May 2025 at 18:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data from periods of such outages is limited.

Forecast updated on Monday at 12:06.

In the coming week, electricity prices on the power exchange will remain at a relatively affordable level. Daily average prices will range between 0.2 cents and 2.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. The most affordable day of the week will be **Tuesday**, when the average price will be only 0.2 cents. Prices on Tuesday will dip into negative values, especially in the early morning hours between 03:00 and 06:00. Tuesday's low price level will be supported by strong winds, which will provide abundant wind energy, occasionally reaching up to 4790 MW.

The highest average daily price will occur on **Wednesday**, when the average price will rise to 2.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, and the maximum hourly price will peak at 7.7 cents between 07:00 and 09:00 in the morning. Wednesday will also exhibit the greatest price fluctuations of the week, partly explained by the low minimum wind power generation (1330 MW). There will also be a risk of individual price spikes on Wednesday, particularly during morning hours.

On **Friday**, the average price will settle at 2.3 cents, without significant hourly peaks during the day. Wind energy production will be abundant throughout the day, keeping price levels moderate around the clock.

Of the weekend days, **Saturday** will be slightly more expensive than Sunday. On Saturday, the average price will be 1.8 cents, and wind power production will be lower than usual. Saturday will also carry a risk of individual hourly price spikes, although the maximum price will remain at 3.6 cents. On **Sunday**, the average price will drop to 0.6 cents, and wind power production will be reasonably good. Several hours of negative electricity prices will occur in the early morning and afternoon hours on Sunday.

Next **Monday**, the average price will slightly rise to 1.9 cents, and the day's maximum will be the second highest of the week at 5.5 cents between 19:00 and 21:00 in the evening. Wind power production on Monday will be relatively low, partly explaining the somewhat elevated price level and the risk of individual hourly price spikes.
