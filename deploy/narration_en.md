On Sunday and Monday, average prices are relatively similar, around 7.6–7.7 ¢/kWh.

Particularly on Tuesday, higher prices are anticipated, with an average price rising to 9.0 ¢. Wind power production is at a low level on Tuesday, which contributes to the price increase.

This risk factor is especially pronounced during Tuesday afternoon and evening.

Cold weather continues throughout the week, but it is not significantly unusual for the winter season. The week's price expectations show clear variations, with Tuesday's higher prices standing out.
