The upcoming week offers fluctuating electricity prices in the Finnish market. **Friday** begins the week with an affordable average price, remaining around 1.3 cents. The day also sees fairly normal wind power, which supports the low prices. **Saturday** continues with reasonable prices, expected to stay below 7 cents, with no significant price spikes anticipated during the day.

On **Sunday**, prices rise noticeably, with the average price forecasted at 7.7 cents. This is partly due to low wind power production, averaging less than 2500 megawatts. As the week progresses, the price level remains similar, with both **Monday** and **Tuesday** average prices settling around 7.7 cents. However, Tuesday is forecasted to have potential price spikes that could reach up to 20 cents during individual hours.

In the middle of the week, the situation changes distinctly. **Wednesday** and **Thursday** stand out as the most expensive days in the forecast, with the average electricity price rising above 11 cents. On Wednesday, the maximum price could reach up to 17.5 cents, and wind power's minimum production remains exceptionally low. This significantly raises the risk of price spikes, with prices potentially exceeding the forecasted maximum by 30-50 cents. Thursday also anticipates high prices, with potential price spikes occurring in the morning and evening hours.

Thus, the coming week is diverse in terms of prices, with particularly high prices on Wednesday and Thursday standing out. According to the forecast, price trends are variable, and potential price spikes add extra excitement for electricity consumers this week. üîç
