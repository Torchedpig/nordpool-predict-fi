Electricity price expectations for the coming week will vary substantially from day to day. On average, however, prices will remain at affordable or normal levels. Particularly large daily variations will occur on **Thursday** and **Tuesday**, when prices will reach the week's highest levels. On **Thursday**, the average price forecast is 5.4 cents, and on Tuesday it reaches as high as 6.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. During individual hours on **Thursday** and **Tuesday**, electricity prices may rise up to 20 cents, making these days the most expensive of the week. Thursday's price peak is expected around midday between 11:00 and 13:00, and Tuesday's peak will likely occur between 18:00 and 20:00.

In the middle of the week, on **Wednesday**, prices will settle into clearly moderate levels, although individual price spikes may still occur. During these spikes, electricity may rise to around 10 cents per kilowatt-hour, especially in mid-morning hours between 09:00 and 11:00. Nevertheless, the day's average price will remain below three cents.

The cheapest days will occur consecutively towards the end of the week. **Friday** will see an average price of just 0.7 cents, and on **Saturday** prices will even dip slightly negative, to -0.1 cents. There is no risk of price spikes on these days, and electricity prices will remain consistently low. On Saturday, electricity prices may drop as low as -1.9 cents during the night and early afternoon hours between 13:00 and 15:00.

**Sunday** and **Monday** are public holidays, which reduces electricity demand and keeps prices moderate. Sunday's average price will be 1.8 cents, but price spikes may briefly raise the price to around 10 cents. These potential price peaks will primarily occur in the evening between 20:00 and 22:00. Monday will see smaller price variations and no expected spikes, with an average price settling at 2.6 cents.

Wind power production will significantly affect prices especially on Friday and Saturday, when wind power will be abundant, averaging over 3000 MW. This will keep electricity prices low on both days. Conversely, the high price peaks on Thursday and Tuesday will coincide with times when wind power minimum production falls below 2000 MW, partly explaining the higher maximum prices.
