The electricity market in the coming week will see considerable daily price fluctuations, especially toward the end of the week. The cheapest days, according to the forecast, will be **Sunday** and **Saturday**, when the average price remains well below one cent per kilowatt hour. On both days, wind power production will remain strong, pushing prices down. On Sunday, price fluctuations even reach negative readings at night, with electricity dipping as low as -0.8 cents.

**Monday** and **Tuesday** will bring slightly higher prices, with average rates rising to around two cents. These days also feature clear intraday variation, as maximum prices reach 4.5 cents on Monday and 4.8 cents on Tuesday. On Tuesday, wind power production momentarily drops below 2000 megawatts, which is reflected in higher hourly prices during the morning and evening.

On Wednesday, the price level will still remain relatively moderate, but during Thursday and especially Friday, a clear increase is visible in the electricity price forecast. **Friday** stands out as the most expensive day of the week: the average price rises to 4.1 cents, and on individual hours the price is expected to reach up to 6.8 cents. Wind power production will be at its lowest for the week on Friday, explaining the higher price level. For both Thursday and Friday, there is an identified risk of price spikes: in single hours, prices may rise up to 10 cents if wind production falls short of expectations. These potential peaks are anticipated especially during Friday's morning and evening hours.

After the weekend, electricity prices will still remain unusually low if wind power production materializes as forecasted. However, day-to-day price variations are clear, and the possible price peaks toward the end of the week are worth noting. Individual hourly prices may change rapidly if weather conditions deviate from the forecast.
