The electricity price forecast for the coming week shows varying figures. The most expensive day of the week will be **Monday**, when the average price of electricity will rise to 12.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. Monday's highest price, 19.5 Â¢, will be between nine in the morning and ten in the evening. On Monday, there is also a risk that the prices of individual hours will rise to as much as 30-50 cents. This is due to low wind power, which is forecast to be at its lowest at only 559 MW.

**Wednesday** is another day when the average price will be high, at 9.1 Â¢. Wednesday's highest price, 17.9 Â¢, will be between eight and ten in the morning. There is also a risk on Wednesday that the prices of individual hours will rise to as much as 20-40 cents, as wind power is forecast to be at its lowest at only 1214 MW.

On **Sunday**, **Thursday**, and **Friday**, the average prices of electricity will be between 7.5 and 8.3 cents. On these days, the highest prices will be during the morning and early evening hours. On Sunday, there is a risk that prices for individual hours could rise to as much as 20-30 cents. On Thursday and Friday the risk is 20 cents.

**Tuesday** will be slightly cheaper, with an average price of 5.6 Â¢. Tuesday's highest price will be between ten and eleven in the morning, when the price may rise to around 9.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. Even on Tuesday, there is a risk that individual hour prices will rise as high as 20 cents.

The cheapest day of the week will be **Saturday**, when the average price will fall to just 2.1 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Saturday afternoon and early evening, prices may even go negative, down to -1.5 cents between 2 PM and 4 PM. This will be explained by the very abundant wind power, which is forecast to be at its highest on Saturday, up to 4883 MW.
