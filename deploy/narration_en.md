The coming week looks variable in terms of electricity prices. Both cheaper and more expensive days are in store. The price level will rise towards the end of the week, and the most expensive days will be at the beginning of next week.

**Friday** is expected to be a more expensive day than average, as the average price for the day is predicted to be 9.7 ¢. The maximum price on Friday may rise to 18.3 cents, but there is a risk of price spikes of up to 20-40 cents for individual hours. Price peaks would most likely occur in the evening, between approximately 5 and 7 PM. Friday's price is pushed up by low wind power production: at its lowest, wind power is expected to be only 497 MW. The average temperature on Friday will also fall to -5.6 degrees, which may have an impact on the price.

Next **Monday**, the price of electricity will rise further. The average price for the day is predicted to be 11.9 ¢, and at its highest, the price may reach 19.3 cents. On Monday, however, it is worth preparing for price spikes of up to 30-50 cents for individual hours, most likely in the early evening around 5-7 PM. At its lowest, Monday's wind power production will fall to 1053 megawatts. **Tuesday's** average price, 12.7 ¢, will also be expensive. On Tuesday, there is also a risk of price spikes of up to 30-50 cents, most likely in the morning around 7-9 AM.

Next **Wednesday**, the average price of electricity is expected to be 10.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. Wednesday's highest price, 15.6 ¢, will occur in the afternoon and early evening hours. A high risk of price spikes of up to 30-40 cents is also predicted for Wednesday for individual hours, most likely in the early evening around 5-7 PM. Wednesday's price is likely to be partly explained by low wind power production, which will fall to a minimum of 1162 megawatts. The average temperature on Wednesday will be -9.3 degrees.

The cheapest hours of the week will be on **Saturday** and **Sunday**, when the price of electricity may fall below four cents per kilowatt-hour. The average price for Saturday is expected to be 7.1 ¢ and for Sunday 6.5 ¢. On both days, wind power is expected to be abundant, which is likely to explain the more affordable price level.
