In the upcoming week, electricity prices will remain affordable overall. Daily average prices will stay under three cents per kilowatt-hour each day. However, there will be some variability between the days, and several negative hourly prices will occur, especially on **Sunday** and **Monday**.

The week's cheapest day will be Sunday, when the average price dips slightly below zero to -0,2 cents. The lowest price on Sunday will occur during the afternoon between 14:00 and 16:00, reaching as low as -2,3 cents. Monday will also see a negative average price (-0,3 ¬¢). On these days, electricity prices will remain consistently low, with no higher prices anticipated.

Higher hourly prices are expected on **Thursday**, when the maximum price will reach up to 5,5 cents in the evening between 19:00 and 21:00. Thursday is also a public holiday, which might reduce electricity demand and thus potentially lower prices. However, Thursday's low wind power production (averaging only 1512 MW) could temporarily drive prices up. Additionally, isolated price spikes may occur during Thursday, particularly during evening hours.

There will also be a risk of isolated hourly price spikes on **Saturday** and **Wednesday**. On Saturday, the highest price is expected to be 4,0 cents early in the morning between 07:00 and 09:00, when wind power production will be quite low, at a minimum of 1222 MW. On Wednesday, price spikes are forecasted in the morning between 07:00 and 09:00, with a peak price of 4,5 cents.

Wind power fluctuations will influence prices particularly on Thursday and Saturday, when average wind production will be low. Conversely, better wind power availability will support negative prices on Sunday and Monday. On Tuesday, prices will largely remain low, although slightly higher prices (maximum 4,1 ¬¢) are predicted in the evening between 18:00 and 20:00.
