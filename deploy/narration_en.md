The price level of electricity will vary greatly in the coming days. On **Friday**, the average daily price will be high, at 12.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. The price peak will occur in the evening between 17:00 and 19:00, when prices may rise even above 25 cents per kilowatt-hour.

During the weekend, electricity prices will be exceptionally low. On **Saturday**, prices will remain negative or very close to zero throughout the day. The average price is forecasted at -0.3 cents. A similar situation will continue on **Sunday**, with an average daily price of only 0.2 cents. Negative prices will especially appear during morning and midday hours on both days.

On **Monday** and **Tuesday**, electricity prices will rise moderately compared to previous days. Monday's average price will be around two cents and Tuesday's slightly above two cents per kilowatt-hour. Price levels will remain stable, with no significant fluctuations expected.

The situation will change starting Wednesday. On **Wednesday**, the average price will rise significantly, up to 9.4 cents. At the same time, the risk of price spikes on Wednesday will be considerable. Prices may rise as high as 20‚Äì40 cents per kilowatt-hour during individual hours, particularly between 07:00 and 09:00 in the morning.

On **Thursday**, the price level will continue to rise, and the day's average price is predicted to reach 11.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. Once again, the risk of high price spikes is significant, with maximum prices potentially reaching 30‚Äì40 cents during certain hours. Thursday's price peaks will likely occur in the evening, especially between 18:00 and 20:00.

The week's price fluctuations can largely be explained by variations in wind power production. During the weekend and the start of the week, wind power production will be strong, keeping prices very low. From Wednesday onward, wind power generation will decrease substantially, clearly driving electricity prices upward.
