*According to forecasts, the spot electricity price will remain moderate next week, but individual hours may see possible price spikes. Price levels fluctuate during the week, and especially the weekend holiday brings exceptionally low price moments.*

A production shortfall is currently ongoing at the Loviisa 2 nuclear power plant, which is estimated to have started on 4 May 2025 at 5:00 PM and to end on 6 May 2025 at 8:00 PM. The available capacity is only 3 megawatts, compared to a nominal output of 248 megawatts. The maintenance outage may affect the forecastâ€™s accuracy, as there is limited training data for this period.

The forecast was updated on Monday at 12:05 PM.

The electricity price forecast for the week is expected to remain mostly moderate, with no exceptionally expensive days in sight. **On Tuesday**, the average price will stay below two cents, with little fluctuation throughout the day. At the same time, wind power is expected to be plentiful, which helps keep the price lower.

**On Wednesday** and **Thursday**, average prices will rise slightly above three cents. Thursday will see the weekâ€™s highest hourly price, during the morning hours (8â€“10 AM), when the price may reach up to 8.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. This is particularly influenced by Thursdayâ€™s low minimum wind power production, which drops to just 321 megawatts. Both days also carry a risk of considerably higher hourly price spikes: on both Wednesday and Thursday, peak hourly prices could reach up to 10 cents if wind power output turns out lower than expected.

**Fridayâ€™s** prices will mostly range between 1 and 7 cents, with the highest average price of the week at 4.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. There is also a risk of hourly price spikes, especially during morning and evening hours. Wind power remains among the lowest levels of the week, which partly explains Fridayâ€™s higher price.

**On Saturday**, the average price will drop slightly, but hourly prices are expected to be around 2â€“4.6 cents. Saturday also carries a possible risk of individual price spikes reaching up to 10 cents per kilowatt-hour. On **Sunday**, which is a public holiday, electricity demand is expected to be lower than usual. As a result, the dayâ€™s average price will be close to one cent, and in some hours, prices may even dip below zero, reaching as low as -1.1 cents during the morning hours. Sunday also carries a risk of price spikes.

Next **Monday**, electricity prices are expected to range between 0.1 and 6.6 cents, with an average of 2.3 cents for the day. There remains a risk of hourly spikes up to 10 cents per kilowatt-hour.

Overall, the electricity price forecast for the coming week will remain clearly below four cents on all days except Friday. The largest price fluctuations are linked to days with low minimum wind power output. The negative minimum price on Sunday stands out as a rarity for the week. The possibility of hourly price spikes should be kept in mind especially on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and next Monday.
