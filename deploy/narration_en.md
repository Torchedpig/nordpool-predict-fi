The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The outage began on 1.3.2025 at 03:00 and is projected to end on 2.5.2025 at 02:00. The maintenance outage may affect forecast accuracy, as training data during plant outages is limited.

Electricity prices in the coming days will show clear variation. The cheapest day of the week will be **Thursday**, when the average electricity price is practically zero. Negative hourly prices will also occur on Thursday afternoon between 13:00 and 17:00. On **Friday**, prices will remain very low as well, with an average price of only 0.4 cents. Negative prices continue overnight into early Friday morning between 02:00 and 06:00.

On **Saturday**, prices will rise slightly compared to previous days, but will remain moderate with a daily average around three cents. However, price fluctuations on Saturday will be significant, as the lowest hourly prices will drop to negative values during nighttime, while in the evening prices will rise above eight cents.

**Monday** will clearly experience the week's highest prices. The daily average will rise to 7.3 cents, and the highest hourly prices will occur in the morning between 08:00 and 10:00. During these hours, individual hourly prices may significantly exceed the forecasted maximum of 16.2 cents, reaching 20â€“30 cents. This is due to a notable decrease in wind power production, which reaches its lowest point on Monday at around 1600 MW.

On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, prices will return to more moderate levels. Tuesday's average price will remain below five cents, and on Wednesday the average price will be clearly below one cent. Both days will experience relatively stable prices, with no significant price increases expected.

Overall, the coming week will offer both exceptionally low and slightly higher electricity price periods. The beginning of the week, especially Monday, clearly stands out with higher prices, whereas later in the week electricity users will find exceptionally affordable opportunities.
