Spot electricity price expectations will stay very low through the weekend. On **Friday** and **Saturday**, average prices will remain well below one cent, with some negative hourly rates overnight, reflecting abundant wind power during those times. **Sunday's** average price will also be low, with the lowest hourly rate dropping to -0.6 cents.

At the start of the week, on **Monday**, the price is forecast to rise significantly. The average will reach 2.1 cents, with a maximum hourly rate of 4.5 cents. This day will see greater intra-day volatility compared to the weekend, and wind power levels will at times fall clearly below the weekend's.

On **Tuesday**, the average price will be 1.6 cents, with a wide daily range: the lowest hour at -0.6 cents and the highest at 4.2 cents. Periods of reduced wind power will explain some of the higher hourly prices. **Wednesday** will see an average price of 1.3 cents with milder fluctuations, though wind power production will briefly hit the week's lowest levels, yet prices will remain moderate.

Next **Thursday**, price expectations will climb to the week's highest. The daily average will be 2.2 cents, with a maximum of 4.6 cents. At the same time, wind power output is forecast to reach its lowest point of the week. There is also an exceptional risk of hourly price spikes on this day, with individual hours possibly reaching even 10 cents.

The cheapest hours will occur during the weekend nights, when prices will dip below zero several times. The most expensive hours will fall on next Thursday, coinciding with the lowest wind power production. There will be clear day-to-day price differences during the week, but overall, spot price expectations should remain moderate.
