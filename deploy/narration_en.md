Distinct price variation will be seen between different days in next week's spot electricity market. The highest average price is expected on **Monday**, when prices are forecast to rise to an average of 7.6 cents, with the daily maximum reaching as high as 22.1 cents. This exceptionally high peak occurs during the morning hours between 8 and 10 a.m., coinciding with a very low minimum wind power production of 172 megawatts. The low wind power minimum explains the strong price fluctuation, especially the highest hourly prices.

**Tuesday** will also see elevated prices, with the average rising to 5.0 cents and the maximum reaching 14.7 cents. The highest hourly prices are expected in the morning around 8–10 a.m., when wind power production is still comparatively low. During these times, there may be individual price spikes.

During the weekend, on **Saturday** and **Sunday**, the price level will remain moderate. Saturday's average is set at 3.9 cents and Sunday at 3.5 cents. Sunday is a public holiday, which typically lowers electricity demand and is also reflected in the low price level. However, there is a risk of individual price spikes on Sunday, especially during morning and afternoon hours when wind power production is at its lowest. On Saturday, wind power stays near the week's lowest levels, contributing to the day's maximum price of 9.0 cents.

In the latter part of the week, on **Wednesday**, **Thursday**, and **Friday**, electricity will remain notably cheaper. Average prices drop to around 1.5 and 1.1 cents, and especially on Thursday, the average falls to 0.7 cents. Negative hourly prices are expected on Thursday and Friday during the night, with electricity prices dipping as low as -1.5 cents. On these days, wind power production increases significantly and remains high, supporting low prices. No risk of price spikes is seen at the end of the week.

In summary, the biggest price fluctuations next week are expected during the mornings of Monday and Tuesday, when wind power production will temporarily be very low. As the week progresses, electricity prices will decrease significantly and negative prices may occur, especially at night. The most affordable hours of the week will be on Thursday morning and Friday night.
