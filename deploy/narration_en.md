The price expectations for exchange electricity will vary significantly over the coming week. On **Friday**, the price will rise significantly higher than on other days. Friday's average price, 10.2 ¢/kWh, will be the highest of the week. Friday's hourly forecast shows a maximum price of 19.2 ¢ at eight o'clock in the morning, but it should be noted that the prices of individual hours can rise up to 30-40 cents. This is partly because wind power is forecast to be very low on Friday morning, at a minimum of only 458 MW. A little frost is also expected.

On **Saturday**, the price of exchange electricity will take a sharp turn downwards. Saturday's average price is expected to be only 2.1 ¢, and during the day the price will even temporarily fall below zero. Very strong wind is forecast for Saturday, with an average of 5457 MW, which explains the low price level.

On **Sunday**, the price will remain low, with an average price of only 1.5 ¢. On Sunday, wind power will still be abundant, with an average of 4698 MW, although the price will temporarily dip below zero. Sunday is the cheapest day of the week.

Next **Monday**, the price will rise slightly, but will remain reasonable, with an average price of 3.3 ¢. On Tuesday and Wednesday, prices will continue at a low level, with average prices of 2.9 ¢ and 2.2 ¢. Next **Tuesday**, the temperature will rise above zero.

Next **Wednesday**, there will be a very large amount of wind power, with an average of 5101 MW. Next Thursday, the average price of electricity will rise slightly, to 3.7 ¢ per kilowatt-hour.
