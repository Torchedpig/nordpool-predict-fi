A maintenance outage is currently ongoing at the Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant in Finland. The outage began on 1 March 2025 at 03:00 and is scheduled to end on 29 April 2025 at 16:00. This may affect the accuracy of this forecast, as training data from periods of nuclear outages is limited.

The electricity price forecast for the coming week indicates considerable daily variation. Ahead lie both very affordable days and slightly higher-priced periods. Daily average prices will range from just above one cent to nearly nine cents per kilowatt-hour.

**Wednesday** will be the week's most expensive day, averaging 8.7 cents. The maximum price may rise even above 14 cents. There is a risk for price spikes, and individual hourly prices may rise as high as 20 cents. The highest prices are forecasted around midnight, between 23:00 and 01:00.

On **Thursday**, a public holiday reduces electricity demand, thus lowering average prices. The expected daily average will be slightly above four cents per kilowatt-hour. Wind power production will be reasonably strong throughout the day, helping to keep prices moderate. However, there remains some risk for price spikes, with individual hourly prices potentially reaching 10 cents.

From **Friday** to Sunday, electricity prices will remain very low. **Saturday** even sees a negative minimum price (-0.1¬¢), indicating that electricity production momentarily exceeds consumption. The week's cheapest day will be **Friday**, with an average price of just 1.3 cents. Wind power generation will be strong throughout the weekend, explaining the low prices.

Next **Monday**, prices will begin to rise again. The daily average will increase to 5.6 cents, with maximum hourly prices exceeding 13 cents during the day. On **Tuesday**, the daily average price continues its moderate rise to 6.8 cents. Again, there is a risk for price spikes, with individual hourly prices potentially reaching as high as 20 cents. The highest prices are expected during evening hours, approximately between 21:00 and 23:00.
