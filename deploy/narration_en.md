*The coming week will see significant fluctuations in electricity prices: the start of the week will feature high prices and risk of price spikes, but as a public holiday approaches, prices will drop markedly, even reaching negative hourly rates towards week's end due to strong wind power production.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance that began on 1.3.2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on 26.4.2025 at 23:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as there is limited historical data available during such outages.

The forecast was updated on Saturday at 00:06.

During the coming week, electricity prices will vary considerably. According to forecasts, **Monday** will be the most expensive day, with an average price reaching 6.9 cents per kilowatt-hour. Monday morning between 7:00 and 9:00 will see peak prices, potentially exceeding 15 cents. Additionally, there will be a high risk of price spikes on Monday, with prices possibly rising to 20–30 cents during individual hours.

On **Tuesday**, the average electricity price will remain relatively high at around 5.7 cents. Tuesday also carries a notable risk of price spikes, with individual hours potentially reaching prices up to 20 cents. The most expensive hours on Tuesday are expected between 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning, partly due to lower wind power generation at that time.

As the week progresses, prices will gradually decrease. On **Wednesday**, the average price will be about 4.2 cents, and on Thursday, which is a public holiday, the price will drop further to approximately 2.7 cents. The holiday may reduce electricity consumption, thus lowering prices. Nevertheless, a risk of price spikes persists on both Wednesday and Thursday, with prices potentially rising momentarily up to 10 cents.

Towards the end of the week, electricity prices will drop significantly. On **Friday**, the average price is forecast to be only 0.7 cents, with hourly prices even going negative, reaching as low as -1.4 cents. Friday's strong wind power production explains the low price level. There is no risk of price spikes on Friday.

On **Saturday**, electricity prices will remain low, with an average around 1.3 cents. The price level will remain stable throughout the day, but a risk of price spikes remains, with prices potentially momentarily rising to around 10 cents.

The week's substantial variation in electricity prices is largely attributable to fluctuations in wind power generation and demand shifts between public holidays and regular weekdays.
