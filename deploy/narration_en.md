The price expectations for exchange electricity will vary during the coming week. Higher prices are expected on **Friday** and Saturday, while the price level will fall significantly towards the end of the week. The most expensive day will be Friday, when the average price of exchange electricity will rise to 9.0 cents per kilowatt-hour. The maximum price for Friday is forecast at 15.0 ¬¢, but there is a risk of price spikes of up to 20-40 cents for individual hours. Price peaks would most likely occur during the morning or early evening hours. Saturday's average price will be slightly lower than Friday's, 8.0 ¬¢/kWh, and there is also a risk of price spikes for individual hours on Saturday, up to 20 cents.

The price of electricity will fall during the weekend. On **Sunday**, the average price will already be significantly cheaper, at 2.8 ¬¢/kWh. Wind power production on Sunday will be very high, averaging 4808 MW, which partly explains the price drop. Between Sunday and Monday night, the price will even fall below zero for a moment.

Next **Monday**, the average price of exchange electricity will be only slightly cheaper than Sunday, at 2.6 ¬¢. On Monday, there will be a very large supply of wind power, averaging 5576 MW, which will keep the price low. Also next **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, the prices of exchange electricity will remain cheap, below two cents per kilowatt-hour. On the night before Wednesday, the price will even drop to -0.5 cents.

Next **Thursday**, the price of exchange electricity will rise again, with an average price of 4.9 ¬¢. Thursday's maximum price, 12.1 ¬¢, will occur in the evening between 6 and 8 pm. There is also a risk on Thursday that prices for individual hours will rise up to 10 cents higher than forecast. Wind power production will be significantly lower on Thursday than on other days.
