Electricity price expectations will vary over the coming week. Electricity will be cheapest on **Tuesday**, when the average daily price is expected to be 2.4 ¢/kWh. During the night between Monday and Tuesday, the price of electricity will even fall below zero. During the day, there will be a very large supply of wind power, which explains the low price level.

On **Wednesday**, the price of electricity will rise, and the average price is forecast to be 7.5 ¢. Wind power production will decrease compared to Tuesday. During the night between Wednesday and Thursday, there will be exceptionally little wind power available, only 303 MW.

On **Thursday**, the average price will rise further, to 9.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. Wind power production will be at a low level on Thursday. In addition, a high risk of price spikes is forecast for Thursday, even up to 20-40 cents for individual hours. The price spikes will likely occur during the morning and early evening hours, around 7-9 AM and 5-7 PM.

**Friday** is expected to have the highest average price of the week, 10.1 ¢. On Friday, wind power is forecast to remain at a low level. Friday's maximum price may rise to 16.5 cents, but actual peak prices could be as high as 30-40 ¢/kWh, most likely in the evening around 5-7 PM.

Over the weekend, the price of electricity will decrease slightly. On **Saturday**, the average price is expected to be 8.2 ¢. A high risk of price spikes is forecast for Saturday, even up to 20-30 cents for individual hours. On **Sunday**, the average price will fall to 6.9 cents. There is also a risk of price spikes on Sunday, possibly up to 20 cents.

Next **Monday**, the price of electricity will settle at 5.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. There will be plenty of wind power available on Monday, which will help to keep the price reasonable.
