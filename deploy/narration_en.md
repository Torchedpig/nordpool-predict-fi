Electricity prices on the exchange will fluctuate significantly in the coming days. The week's highest prices will occur on **Tuesday**, when the expected average price is 6.5 cents per kilowatt-hour and hourly price variation will be high. The most expensive electricity will be purchased on Tuesday morning between 7‚Äì9, when the maximum price reaches 22.8 cents. Tuesday's price variations are partly explained by very low wind production in the morning, with wind power availability at only 700 MW at its lowest.

On **Wednesday**, wind power production will rise to an exceptionally high level, averaging over 6300 MW. This abundant wind power availability will push electricity prices very low, even negative during nighttime and early morning hours. Wednesday's price will remain very low throughout the day, with an average price of only 0.3 cents per kilowatt-hour.

On **Thursday**, electricity prices are expected to rise again. The day's average price will reach 4.8 cents, and price fluctuations will be significant. Price peaks on Thursday morning between 8‚Äì10 will reach 17.3 cents. The risk of price spikes on Thursday is significant: actual prices may exceed forecasts, possibly rising to between 10‚Äì20 cents during individual hours. Particularly the morning's low minimum wind power production (437 MW) increases the risk of price spikes.

Moving towards the weekend, electricity prices will decrease again. Average prices on **Friday**, **Saturday**, and **Sunday** will remain below two cents. Friday will see the week's lowest hourly price, -1.4 cents during early morning hours. Saturday's prices will also remain moderate, with an average daily price of 1.7 cents. On Sunday, electricity will still be inexpensive, although the possibility of price spikes must be considered especially in the morning hours. On Sunday, individual hourly prices may rise up to 10 cents.

On **Monday**, electricity prices are expected to rise back towards normal levels. The day's average price will be 4.5 cents, with the highest hourly prices occurring in the morning, reaching up to 11.6 cents.
