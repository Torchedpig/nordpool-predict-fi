The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage. Its nominal capacity is 1600.0 MW, but the available capacity at the moment is 0 MW. The outage began on 1 March 2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on 2 May 2025 at 02:00. This maintenance break may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as there is limited training data available during outages.

The electricity price forecast for the upcoming week will vary significantly. The beginning of the week will be clearly more expensive than the end. Price levels will decline gradually as the weekend approaches, and particularly from midweek onwards, prices will be exceptionally low.

The most expensive day of the week will be **Monday**, with an average price rising to 15.0 cents per kilowatt-hour. Monday's price variations will be notable: prices will exceed 25 cents between 8‚Äì10 in the morning, and the day's highest hourly rate will reach up to 33.3 cents during the same time frame. This high price is largely due to exceptionally low wind power production, which will drop to just 145 megawatts in the morning.

On **Tuesday**, the average price will still be high at 10.0 ¬¢/kWh. Although the daily forecast does not indicate an exceptionally high peak price, Tuesday has a marked high risk of price spikes. Actual prices during individual hours could rise even as high as 20‚Äì40 cents. These anticipated price spikes will likely occur around morning (8‚Äì10) or evening (18‚Äì20) hours.

From midweek onwards, prices will drop markedly. The average prices for **Wednesday** and **Thursday** will remain below four cents. The cheapest day of the week will be **Friday**, when electricity prices will stay very low throughout the entire day. On Friday, prices will even turn negative, reaching as low as -0.2 cents overnight between 16‚Äì18.

Weekend prices will also remain affordable. On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, negative prices will again be observed. Saturday's lowest price will be -1.8 cents, and Sunday's even lower at -2.6 cents. Over the weekend, electricity usage will thus be particularly economical, especially at night and during early afternoon hours.
