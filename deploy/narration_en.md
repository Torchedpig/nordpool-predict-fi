*Next week's electricity market prices will experience clear spikes early in the week, but toward the end of the week, prices will stabilize significantly. On Monday, prices may momentarily peak high, whereas on Thursday and Friday, electricity will be exceptionally cheap, even negative.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage. The maintenance began on March 1, 2025, at 03:00 and is expected to last until April 27, 2025, at 23:00. This outage may affect the accuracy of this forecast, as training data during maintenance periods is limited.

The forecast was updated on Saturday at 21:04.

Next week's price expectations will vary considerably from day to day. At the beginning of the week, electricity will be clearly more expensive compared to the latter half of the week. According to forecasts, **Monday** will be the most expensive day of the week measured by the average price (7.1 ¬¢/kWh). On Monday, the maximum price will also sharply rise, reaching 15.4 cents between 8:00 and 10:00, with an additional significant risk of even higher price spikes. Monday's peak prices could climb as high as 20‚Äì30 cents during individual hours. This elevated price level will partly be explained by low wind power production in the morning hours, when wind production will drop to as low as 487 MW.

On **Sunday**, price fluctuations will be greatest: the cheapest hours of the day will occur around noon between 14:00 and 16:00, when electricity prices will turn slightly negative (-0.4 ¬¢). In contrast, evening hours from 19:00 to 21:00 will be considerably more expensive, reaching up to 19.2 cents. Wind power production will remain relatively low on Sunday as well (averaging 1307 MW), contributing to significant price volatility.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, electricity prices will clearly decrease compared to the week's start. **Tuesday's** average price of 4.8 cents and **Wednesday's** 2.3 cents indicate a significant drop in prices. These days will see gradually increasing wind power production, partly explaining the fall in electricity prices. However, Tuesday still carries a small risk of short-term price spikes reaching up to 10 cents. Wednesday's prices will remain moderate, though the same magnitude of risk for brief price spikes will still exist.

Later in the week, on **Thursday** and **Friday**, electricity prices will decline further. Thursday is a public holiday, when energy demand will be lower than usual, reflected clearly in prices. On Thursday, electricity will cost on average only 0.4 cents, with the day's lowest prices again turning negative, down to -1 cent. There will be virtually no risk of price spikes on Thursday. On Friday, electricity will also remain inexpensive, with the average price at 0.8 cents and the maximum price at 2.7 cents. Friday's significant increase in wind power (averaging 3129 MW) will coincide with these exceptionally low prices.

On **Saturday**, prices will rise slightly compared to preceding days but will still remain low, averaging 1.8 cents. Nevertheless, Saturday will still carry a risk for brief price spikes, potentially causing electricity prices to momentarily rise up to 10 cents.
