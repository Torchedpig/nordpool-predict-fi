The upcoming week's electricity market will see price fluctuations, with Monday and Thursday standing out in particular. Monday is expected to have a high average price of 8.6 cents per kilowatt-hour, with a maximum price potentially reaching 14.3 cents. The relatively low amount of wind power may partly explain the higher price levels.

**Thursday** is also predicted to have significant price variations. The average price remains at seven cents, but the day's maximum price could rise to as much as 17.0 cents. The risk of high price spikes has been noted, with prices potentially increasing to 20-30 cents during individual hours, particularly in the evening.

The most affordable prices of the week are expected on **Friday**, with an average price of 1.2 cents and a maximum of 2.7 cents. This is partly due to strong wind power, which stabilizes price fluctuations. **Saturday** and **Tuesday** offer more moderate average pricing, but prices rise again on Sunday, reaching the highest average of the week at seven cents.

**Wednesday** is expected to be slightly more affordable, with an average price of 4.5 cents. Although wind power is strong on Wednesday, it is not enough to significantly lower prices.

In summary, next week offers a diverse price development, with both consumers and industry advised to closely monitor market changes. üå¨Ô∏è
