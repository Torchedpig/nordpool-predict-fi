*The coming week's electricity spot prices will remain mostly very affordable, occasionally even dipping into negative territory, but on Friday morning there will be a brief price spike reaching nearly ten cents. Due to Thursday being a public holiday, demand may be lower, potentially further depressing prices.*

In the coming week, the electricity spot price level will remain predominantly low. Daily average prices throughout the week are forecasted to remain below three cents. However, price fluctuations between days will be notable, and negative prices will also occur on several days.

The week's lowest prices will be experienced on **Monday** and **Tuesday**, when electricity prices will fall into negative territory during nighttime and early morning hours. The lowest price occurs early **Monday**, around 2 AM, when electricity prices will drop to -1,0 cents. Similarly, on **Tuesday** from 1 PM to 3 PM, electricity prices will dip into negative numbers, bottoming out at -1,2 cents.

Midweek remains moderately affordable. **Thursday**, a public holiday, might see lower than usual electricity demand, potentially further lowering prices. Nevertheless, Thursday carries a slight risk of occasional price spikes, with electricity prices reaching nearly three cents between 6 PM and 8 PM.

Clearly the most expensive day of the upcoming week will be **Friday**, when the average electricity price climbs to 2,7 cents per kilowatt-hour. On that day, price fluctuations will be significant: the lowest price is just 0,3 cents, whereas the highest approaches ten cents between 8 AM and 10 AM. Especially in the morning, around 9 AM, electricity prices will peak at the week's highest level of 9,8 cents. At this time, there is also an elevated risk of individual price spikes.

On Saturday, prices will again drop significantly. The average electricity price will hover around zero cents, with large price fluctuations once more; at its lowest, electricity prices will reach -1,4 cents. Nonetheless, there remains a small risk of individual price spikes on Saturday, primarily during evening hours.

Overall, the forthcoming week offers exceptionally affordable electricity prices, although attention is warranted on Friday morning when prices will briefly rise significantly.
