In the coming days, electricity prices will remain mostly very affordable. Average prices will vary from slightly negative values up to nearly six cents during the week. Significant variation will appear especially on **Monday**, when prices will momentarily rise exceptionally high.

The weekend will offer very inexpensive electricity. On **Saturday**, the average price will remain below one cent, with prices around zero cents during the day. **Sunday** will be even cheaper: several negative price hours will occur, with the lowest at -1.7 cents during the afternoon between 12:00 and 16:00.

The clearly exceptional day of the week will be Monday, when the average electricity price will rise to 5.9 cents. On Monday, there will be a notable risk of price spikes, especially in the morning between 8:00 and 10:00. During this time, the price will rise above 20 cents. This will mainly be due to very low wind power production, which will reach a minimum of just 128 MW.

After Monday, prices will return to very low levels again. On **Tuesday**, **Wednesday**, and **Thursday**, electricity prices will stay clearly below one cent on average. Some negative hourly prices will also be seen overnight and in the mornings, for example during the early hours of Thursday.

Towards the end of the week, on **Friday**, electricity prices will rise somewhat higher. The average price will increase to 3.8 cents, and the highest prices of the day will occur in the evening between 20:00 and 22:00, reaching nearly nine cents.

In summary, the greatest price fluctuations will occur on Monday, while prices on other days will remain mostly very low.
