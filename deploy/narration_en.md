The electricity price forecast for the coming week shows fluctuating price levels. The price will be higher over the weekend, but next week price expectations will fall to a significantly more affordable level.

On **Friday**, the average price of electricity on the power exchange will be 7.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. Friday's highest price, 19.6 ¬¢, will be in the evening between 6 PM and 8 PM. The cheapest time of the day will be in the early hours of the morning between 3 AM and 4 AM, when the price will fall to just 0.3 cents. Price fluctuations on Friday will be large, which is partly explained by large variations in wind power production. Wind power will be available at a minimum of 858 MW, but at a maximum of 3546 MW.

On **Saturday**, the average price of electricity will be very close to Friday's figures, at 7.5 cents. However, on Saturday there is a high risk of price spikes, with prices for individual hours potentially rising as high as 20-30 cents. Saturday's minimum wind power production will be 854 megawatts, which partly explains the risk of price spikes.

On **Sunday**, price expectations will turn significantly more affordable. The average price will be 3.2 cents, and the highest price of the day will be 7.4 ¬¢. On Sunday, there will be plenty of wind power available, with an average of 4565 MW.

Next week, the price of electricity on the power exchange will continue to fall. On **Monday**, the average price will be 2.1 ¬¢, and on **Tuesday** only 1.7 ¬¢. On Tuesday, in the early hours of the morning, the price will even fall to -0.6 cents. The price forecasts for next **Wednesday** and **Thursday** are also affordable, at 1.9 ¬¢ and 1.3 ¬¢. Throughout next week, there will be a very large amount of wind power available, which explains the affordable prices.
