During the upcoming week, electricity prices will experience notable daily fluctuations. The cheapest days will be **Saturday** and **Wednesday**, when average daily prices remain clearly below four cents. On Wednesday, electricity prices will even become negative during the quiet hours of the night, dropping as low as -1.3 ¬¢ between 03:00‚Äì05:00.

The highest average price of the week will occur on **Sunday**, with the daily average reaching 8.1 cents. During Sunday, the price is expected to vary moderately between 5.2 and 12.9 cents. However, forecast models indicate a significant risk of price spikes on Sunday, potentially elevating electricity prices to as high as 20‚Äì30 cents during individual hours.

**Monday** also will have variable prices. According to forecasts, Monday's maximum price will reach 16.2 ¬¢ between 08:00‚Äì10:00 in the morning, but there is also a substantial risk of price spikes up to 20‚Äì30 cents. The variability in Monday's prices is particularly driven by fluctuations in wind power production, as wind generation briefly drops below 1000 megawatts during the morning.

From Tuesday to Thursday, prices will stabilize and remain mostly affordable. **Tuesday** and **Thursday** will both have daily average prices of 3.7 cents. On **Tuesday**, prices are expected to remain below ten cents throughout the whole day. **Thursday** will also be relatively inexpensive, with prices not anticipated to exceed eight cents.

Towards the end of the week, on **Friday**, price levels will rise slightly, with the daily average reaching 6.4 cents. Again, Friday carries a risk of significant price spikes, potentially reaching as high as 20‚Äì30 cents during individual hours. Part of Friday's price increase can be explained by low wind power production, as wind generation temporarily weakens significantly below 1000 megawatts.
