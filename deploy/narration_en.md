*Next week's electricity markets present varying prices, from affordable weekends to high peak prices on Friday. The risk of price spikes increases as the week progresses, especially from Wednesday onwards, when wind power production decreases.*

The forecast for electricity prices has been updated on Friday at 14:18.

Next week, electricity prices on the market will vary significantly. **Saturday** and **Sunday** are expected to remain relatively affordable, with an average price slightly above 5 ¢/kWh. However, on Saturday, prices may fluctuate greatly between individual hours, starting at 0.6 ¢ and rising to 11.4 ¢. This variation may be due to fluctuations in wind power production during the day.

**Monday** and **Tuesday** offer reasonable prices, although with a slightly higher average than the weekend. Wind power production remains at an average normal level on these days. **Wednesday** stands out in the week's forecasts as a higher price day, with an average price rising to 9.8 ¢. A high risk of price spikes could raise individual hourly prices to as much as 20-40 ¢.

Towards the end of the week, **Thursday** and **Friday**, prices continue to rise. Friday is forecasted to have the highest average price of the week at 14.3 ¢, and price spikes could reach up to 30-60 ¢. This is partly due to low wind power production.

Overall, forecasts show significant variation between days, and especially for Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, the risk of price spikes should be considered. 🌬️
