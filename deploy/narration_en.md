Significant differences between days will characterize electricity price forecasts for the coming week. On Tuesday and Wednesday, prices will fluctuate considerably within each day. On **Tuesday**, the average price will be 5.8 cents, but during the night and morning hours, electricity will be very inexpensive, approaching zero. However, during evening hours from 21:00 to 23:00, prices will rise sharply, reaching as high as 28.0 cents. **Wednesday** will have the highest daily average price of the week at 8.4 cents. Early morning hours on Wednesday, specifically between 00:00 and 02:00, will be among the week's most expensive, with prices hovering around 10 cents. Additionally, Wednesday carries a clear risk of price spikes: individual hourly prices may rise as high as 20 cents.

**Thursday** is a public holiday, leading to lower-than-average electricity demand. This will result in a relatively low average price of only 2.0 cents. However, there remains a high risk of individual price spikes, with hourly prices potentially rising up to 10 cents. Nevertheless, pricing will remain moderate overall, with early morning hours being particularly affordable.

The cheapest days of the week will be **Friday** and **Saturday**. Friday's average price, at 1.3 cents, will be very low, and prices will remain inexpensive throughout the day. On Saturday, the average price will drop even further to just 0.6 cents, with prices turning negative during certain hours, reaching as low as -0.5 cents. **Sunday** will also maintain moderate prices, averaging 1.9 cents, with relatively little price variation.

Next **Monday**, prices will rise slightly again, averaging 5.2 cents. During the day, prices will vary between 2.2 and 8.8 cents. No significant price spikes are expected.
