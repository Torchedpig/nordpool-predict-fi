Electricity price expectations will vary during the coming week. **Thursday** and **Friday** are expected to be significantly more expensive days than the others. Average prices on Thursday and Friday will be over 11 cents per kilowatt-hour.

Thursday and Friday's prices are driven up by the predicted low wind power production. Wind power is estimated to be available on Thursday at an average of only 1832 MW and on Friday 1750 MW. On both days, the minimum wind power production will remain below 2000 megawatts, which partly explains the higher maximum prices. There is also a high risk of price spikes on Thursday and Friday. Prices for individual hours can rise up to 30-40 cents per kilowatt-hour. The price spikes are likely to occur during the morning hours around 7-9 am or in the early evening around 5-7 pm.

On **Wednesday**, the average price of electricity is expected to settle around 6.2 cents. Wednesday's forecast includes a mention of the risk of a price spike, and prices for individual hours could rise as high as 20 cents.

Electricity is expected to be cheap over the weekend. The average price for **Saturday** is estimated at 3.9 ¢ and for **Sunday** at 3.4 ¢. On Saturday, wind power is forecast to be abundant, averaging 3474 MW, and on Sunday as much as 4817 MW. On Sunday morning, the price of electricity may even approach zero.

Next **Monday** and **Tuesday**, the average prices of electricity will remain cheap, around 3.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. On the night between Sunday and Monday and the night between Monday and Tuesday, the price of electricity is expected to fall below zero. On Monday, wind power will be abundant, and on Tuesday, wind power production will remain at a reasonably high level.
