The price of electricity will vary considerably over the coming week. The cheapest exchange electricity prices will be on Saturday, when the average daily price will remain below two cents per kilowatt-hour. Electricity will be most expensive next Wednesday, when the average price rises above 10 cents. The maximum price for Wednesday is forecast to be 19.7 Â¢, but there is a high risk that the prices of individual hours will rise as high as 30-40 cents per kilowatt-hour.

On **Saturday**, the price of electricity on the exchange will be very cheap, as there will be plenty of wind power available, on average more than 5200 megawatts. On individual hours, the price may even fall close to zero. The average price for Saturday is expected to be 1.8 Â¢/kWh.

On **Friday**, **Sunday**, **Monday** and **Tuesday**, there is a risk that the prices of individual hours will rise as high as 20 cents per kilowatt-hour. On these days, price peaks are likely to occur during the morning or evening hours. For example, on Tuesday, the highest price, 14.4 Â¢, is expected between 18:00 and 20:00. On Tuesday, it is also possible that the price of electricity on the exchange will temporarily fall below zero at night.

Next Wednesday, the price of electricity will rise significantly higher than on other days. The average price for Wednesday is expected to be 10.7 Â¢/kWh. The price will be pushed up by low wind power production, as wind power is forecast to be available on average only about 2300 megawatts. In addition, the weather will cool down, and the average daily temperature will fall to -4.3 degrees. Wednesday also has a high risk of price spikes, with prices for individual hours potentially rising as high as 30-40 cents.
