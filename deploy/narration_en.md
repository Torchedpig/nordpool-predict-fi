*'The price of electricity on the exchange will be low at the beginning of the week, but will rise towards the end of the week. On Thursday and Friday, there is a risk of price spikes for individual hours, when the price of electricity could rise up to 20 cents per kilowatt-hour due to low wind power. Olkiluoto 2 has a production deficit.'*

Olkiluoto 2 nuclear power plant is currently experiencing a production deficit, which began on Friday at 10:00 AM and is estimated to end on Friday at 11:00 AM. Because there is limited teaching data available for periods of production deficits, this may affect the accuracy of the forecast.

Electricity price expectations will vary during the coming week. At the beginning of the week, the price of electricity will settle at a very affordable level, but towards the end of the week the price will rise.

On **Saturday** and Sunday, the average price of electricity will remain below one cent per kilowatt-hour. On Saturday, it is even expected that the price will fall below zero for a few hours during the night and morning. On Sunday, the cheapest hours will be around midnight.

Next **Monday** and Tuesday, the average price of electricity will remain low. On the nights between Monday and Tuesday, the price may dip below zero. On Tuesday, the price will start to rise in the afternoon.

Next **Wednesday**, the average price of electricity will rise to seven cents. At its most expensive, the price will be in the morning between 9-11 AM, when it will be around 10 cents per kilowatt-hour.

Next **Thursday**, the average price of electricity is estimated to be 7.4 ¢. However, the price will vary significantly during the day. In the early morning hours, the price will remain below three cents, but in the evening the price will rise above 10 cents. Because wind power is forecast to be low at times on Thursday, there is a risk that the prices of individual hours will rise up to 20 cents. The price spike is likely to occur in the early evening, around 5-7 PM.

Next **Friday**, the average price of electricity will settle at 7.5 cents. On the night before Friday, the price will be below six cents, but during the day the price will climb above 10 cents. Also for Friday, only low wind power has been forecast, so the risk of price spikes for individual hours increases, and the price may rise up to 20 cents. The most likely time for the price peak is in the morning between 8-10 AM.
