*Electricity market prices will remain mostly low in the coming week, but temporary price spikes are expected on Tuesday and Sunday; the ongoing maintenance break at Olkiluoto 3 could affect forecast accuracy.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is undergoing a maintenance outage that started on 1.3.2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on 2.5.2025 at 02:00. This maintenance break may affect the accuracy of price forecasts, as limited training data is available during such outages.

The electricity price forecast was updated on Sunday at 03:13.

During the upcoming week, electricity market prices will stay mostly at affordable levels. Average daily prices will vary from slightly negative values on Saturday to nearly five cents per kilowatt-hour on Tuesday. The week's highest price peaks are expected on **Tuesday**, when the maximum price may rise above 13 cents. Additionally, there is a significant risk of individual hourly price spikes on Tuesday, potentially reaching 10–20 cents. This is primarily due to very low wind power generation, which may drop below 600 megawatts during the day. Tuesday's price peaks are most likely to occur in the evening between 19:00 and 21:00.

At the beginning of the week, particularly on **Monday** and **Wednesday**, prices will remain moderate, occasionally even negative. Early Monday morning, prices will drop as low as -1.4 cents, as wind power generation peaks at nearly 5900 megawatts. Wednesday's prices will also remain clearly below average, with negative prices again observed during nighttime hours.

On **Friday** and **Saturday**, price trends will remain very affordable. Friday's public holiday will reduce electricity consumption, helping to keep prices low with an average daily price of only 0.3 cents. On Saturday, prices are expected to average slightly negative throughout the whole day, reaching as low as -2.0 cents.

On **Sunday**, price trends will again become slightly more volatile. The expected average price will still be low, around 1.8 cents, but low wind power production may lead to price spikes, especially in the evening. Individual hourly prices might rise up to 10 cents, particularly between 18:00 and 20:00.

Overall, the week will appear affordable from the consumer's perspective, except for temporary price increases on Tuesday and Sunday. Price fluctuations will be significant, however, so electricity users may benefit from scheduling consumption during cheaper nighttime hours, especially at the beginning of the week.
