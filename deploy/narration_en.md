The coming week looks quite variable in terms of electricity exchange prices. Price expectations will vary considerably during the week, and especially towards the end of the week, prices are predicted to rise.

On **Friday**, the average price of exchange electricity is expected to settle at 1.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. The price will fluctuate during the day from -0.2 cents to 5.6 cents. With Friday's average temperature being -3.4 degrees, freezing weather may affect heating needs and thus, in part, prices. During the night hours, the price drops close to zero or even slightly below it.

On **Saturday**, the price of electricity will continue to fall, and the average price is predicted to be only 0.7 ¢/kWh. The intraday variation is from -0.6 cents to 1.6 cents. On Saturday and Sunday, the price of electricity will fall below zero at its lowest.

On **Sunday**, the average price will rise again slightly, being 2.4 ¢/kWh. The price will fluctuate from 0.4 cents to 5.1 cents per kilowatt-hour. At the weekend, the price of electricity will therefore be, on average, affordable.

The week that starts on **Monday** begins very affordably, as the average price of exchange electricity is predicted to be only 0.5 ¢/kWh. The price will remain low, varying between -0.6 and 1.3 cents.

On **Tuesday**, the price will turn upwards, and the average price is expected to be 3.8 ¢/kWh. During the day, the price will fluctuate from -1.4 cents to 8.6 cents. Tuesday's lowest price will even fall to -1.4 cents, which is the lowest figure of the week.

Next **Wednesday**, the average price of exchange electricity will rise to 5.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. The price will fluctuate during the day from 2.2 cents to 8.7 cents. Next **Thursday**, the average price will rise further to 7.7 cents. Thursday's price will vary from 2.4 cents to as much as 15.4 cents per kilowatt-hour, which is the highest price forecast of the week. Wind power is predicted to be significantly lower on Thursday than on other days of the week, and production will fall to a minimum of only 918 megawatts. There is also a high risk of price spikes on Thursday, with prices for individual hours potentially rising as high as 20-30 cents. The most likely time for price spikes is between 2 and 4 p.m.
