On **Friday**, the average price of electricity will remain at 0.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. During Friday, the price will even dip slightly below zero during the early morning hours. Friday's average temperature will settle at -3.4 degrees Celsius.

On **Monday**, electricity will still be quite affordable, with an average price of only one cent. At night, the price will go below zero.

Next **Tuesday**, the average price will rise to nearly four cents, but the price will fluctuate during the day: it will be below zero at night, but in the afternoon and early evening, the price will rise above eight cents.

On **Wednesday**, the average price will be over five cents, and the price will vary during the day from two cents to over eight cents.

The most expensive day of the coming week is forecast to be **Thursday**, when the average price of electricity will rise to nearly ten cents. Price variation will be large, as the price will be below three cents at its lowest during the day, but significantly higher prices are expected in the evening. On Thursday, there is also a risk of higher-than-normal price spikes, even 20-40 cents for individual hours, most likely between 6 PM and 8 PM. The risk of price spikes is explained by low wind power production, which may remain below one thousand megawatts during the day.
