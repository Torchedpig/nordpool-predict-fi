*Electricity prices will remain exceptionally low over the weekend, even dipping briefly into negative values, but on Thursday, prices will rise significantly due to low wind power production; the maintenance outage at Olkiluoto 3 may affect forecast accuracy.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage, which started on 01.03.2025 at 03:00 and, according to forecasts, will end on 02.05.2025 at 02:00. The outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data from outage periods is limited.

Forecast updated on Friday at 14:26.

In the coming days, electricity prices will vary significantly depending on the weekday. Over the weekend, **Saturday** and **Sunday** will be particularly inexpensive, with average prices staying around just 0.1 cents. On both days, the electricity price will briefly turn negative: on Saturday, as low as -1.3 ¢, and on Sunday, as low as -0.5 ¢.

The cheapest moments of the week will occur on Saturday between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m., when the electricity price will clearly drop negative (-1.3 ¢). Also, on Sunday between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m., prices will dip below zero (-0.5 ¢).

At the start of the new week, electricity prices will rise significantly. On **Monday**, the average price will climb to 3.9 cents, and on Tuesday, it will settle at 2.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. Although early-week prices will be noticeably higher than on the weekend, they will still remain relatively affordable.

The highest average price of the week will occur on **Thursday**, when the day's average price reaches 7.7 cents. During that day, intraday price fluctuations will also be notable, with the maximum price approaching 12 cents. Additionally, there will be a risk of price spikes on Thursday, when electricity prices could momentarily rise up to around 20 cents per kilowatt-hour. Particularly high price peaks might appear in the morning around 8 a.m. and again in the evening around 6 p.m.

On **Friday**, prices will return to more moderate levels, with the average price staying below four cents. The week's overall price structure clearly reflects variations in wind power production: low prices on the weekend correspond with abundant wind generation, whereas higher prices on Thursday can be explained by significantly reduced wind power production.
