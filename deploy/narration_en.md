Price forecasts will vary significantly in the coming days. The week will start moderately, but prices are expected to rise clearly toward the beginning of next week.

On **Thursday**, electricity will cost on average just under five cents, but price fluctuations during the day will be considerable. Prices could briefly dip slightly negative early in the morning around 1‚Äì2 AM. However, later in the morning between 9‚Äì11 AM, prices could rise to slightly over ten cents. There is also a high risk of price spikes on Thursday, when electricity prices may rise as high as 10‚Äì20 ¬¢ per hour.

The public holiday on **Friday** stands out positively, as the expected average electricity price will remain below one cent. The day's lowest price, -1.4 cents, will be reached early in the morning, around 5 AM. The cheapest days of the week overall will be **Saturday** and **Sunday**, with average prices hovering around zero cents and multiple hours of negative pricing on both days. The week's lowest hourly price, -2.2 cents, will occur on Saturday around 2 PM.

Next week will begin with rising prices. The public holiday on **Monday** will still be fairly affordable, averaging roughly four cents, but with some risk of price spikes. The week's highest average price, nearly nine cents, will occur on **Tuesday**, when hourly prices could peak at 15 cents between 7‚Äì9 AM. Additionally, Tuesday carries a high risk of even more severe price spikes, potentially pushing hourly prices momentarily as high as 20‚Äì40 cents. Prices will calm somewhat by **Wednesday**, settling around six cents on average, but the risk of price spikes remains.

Tuesday's rising prices are partially explained by very weak wind power generation, averaging only around 1190 MW. This represents the week's lowest average wind production and could significantly contribute to the higher electricity prices.
