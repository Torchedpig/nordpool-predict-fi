Electricity prices for the coming week are expected to remain affordable on average. However, clear differences between individual days will be observed. Particularly **Monday** stands out with a significantly higher average price and exceptional peak prices. Monday's anticipated average price is 4,8 cents per kilowatt-hour. During the morning hours from 8:00 to 10:00, there is a clear risk of price spikes, when electricity may briefly cost over 20 cents per kilowatt-hour.

Prices during the weekend are forecasted significantly lower. On **Saturday**, the average price will remain below one cent (0,8 ¢), even dipping slightly below zero during the afternoon from 12:00 to 16:00. **Sunday** will have the week's lowest price level, with electricity averaging just 0,1 cents. Consumers may even benefit from negative prices during daytime hours from 11:00 to 17:00, meaning electricity can momentarily be free or even yield a payment when fed back into the grid.

Prices remain very low mid-week as well. On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, prices are nearly as low as on Sunday, with even peak daily prices not exceeding four cents. **Thursday** also remains inexpensive, with an average price slightly above one cent.

Towards the end of next week, on **Friday**, the price level will rise slightly but remain comparatively low. The expected average price is three cents per kilowatt-hour. The highest prices on Friday are anticipated in the evening hours between 22:00 and 24:00, peaking at around 5,6 cents.

The distinct differences in electricity prices over the week can partially be explained by variations in wind power production. On Monday, wind power generation will be particularly low, contributing to higher electricity prices. On other days, wind power remains at normal or high levels, explaining the lower price forecasts.
