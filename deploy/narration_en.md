The price of exchange electricity will turn to a clear increase next week. Prices will remain affordable from Sunday to Tuesday, but from Wednesday onwards, prices will rise significantly.

On **Sunday**, the average price of exchange electricity will remain at 0.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. During the night and morning, the price will even go below zero. On Sunday, there will be a very large supply of wind power, which explains the affordable price level.

On **Monday**, the average price of exchange electricity will settle at 1.4 cents. For four hours in the early morning, the price of electricity will fall close to zero, but in the morning and forenoon, a small increase will be seen, at its highest around seven cents. Even on Monday, there will be plenty of wind power available. On **Tuesday**, the average price will rise to close to four cents, and the intraday variation will be greater. Tuesday's lowest price will fall to -1.1 cents at night, but in the afternoon and evening, the price will climb above eight cents.

On **Wednesday**, the average price of exchange electricity will rise to close to ten cents. On Wednesday, wind power production will remain at a low level, which partly explains the price increase. At its most expensive, electricity will be between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, even close to 15 cents per kilowatt-hour. Towards the end of the week, wind power production will remain low. Price spikes are expected on Wednesday, when the prices of individual hours can rise up to 20 cents.

On **Thursday**, the average price of exchange electricity will be 8.5 ¢. Although Thursday's maximum price will remain slightly lower than Wednesday's according to the forecast, there is also a risk of price spikes on Thursday. The prices of individual hours can rise up to 20 cents, most likely between eight and ten o'clock in the morning. The average price for **Friday** will settle at 8.3 cents, and the risk of price spikes will continue similar to the two previous days.

Next **Saturday**, the average price of exchange electricity will rise to 9.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Saturday, the risk of price spikes is particularly high, and the prices of individual hours can rise up to 20-40 cents. Peak prices are likely to occur during the afternoon and evening hours, around 5-7 PM. On Saturday, wind power is forecast to remain at its lowest level of the whole week.
