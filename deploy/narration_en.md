Electricity prices will vary significantly during the upcoming week. Thursday will see the highest average price, at approximately 8.9 cents per kilowatt-hour. Although Thursday's maximum hourly price is forecasted at 14 cents, there is a notable risk of individual price spikes reaching as high as 20–40 cents. Such price spikes are expected during morning hours, approximately between 7–9 am. The elevated prices on Thursday will largely result from exceptionally low wind power production—only 593 megawatts at its minimum during the night and morning.

Friday will also exhibit significant price fluctuations. The daily average will reach around 5.8 cents per kilowatt-hour, but prices may spike to as high as 20 cents for individual hours. These potential spikes will likely appear in the morning hours between 7–9 am. Wind power production on Friday will remain relatively low, dropping to a minimum of just 729 megawatts.

The cheapest days of the week will be Wednesday and Saturday. On Wednesday, electricity prices will even turn negative at night, hitting a low of -0.6 cents. The daily average will remain moderate, around 1.7 cents. Saturday will see similarly low prices, averaging about 1.6 cents, with hourly prices again dipping into negative territory, as low as -0.8 cents.

Prices on Sunday and Monday will remain moderate. Sunday's average will be approximately 3.5 cents, without any notable price hikes. On Monday, the average price will rise slightly to 5.6 cents, with greater fluctuations throughout the day. Individual price spikes could push prices up to 20 cents, particularly during evening hours, approximately between 6–8 pm.

On Tuesday, electricity will average around 6.3 cents, again with a possibility of price spikes. Wind power production will occasionally drop to a low of 1901 megawatts, which could cause hourly prices to surge up to 20 cents. The risk of price peaks will be highest in the morning, approximately between 7–9 am.
