*During the upcoming week, electricity spot prices will generally remain very low, but on Wednesday and partly on Monday, limited wind power production in the morning hours will temporarily increase electricity prices significantly higher than the rest of the week, even exceeding 13 cents per kilowatt-hour.*

The Olkiluoto 1 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage. The outage started on May 11, 2025, at 6 pm and is expected to end on May 22, 2025, at 6 pm. This maintenance outage may affect forecast accuracy, as historical data during outages is limited.

During the upcoming week, electricity spot prices will remain low on average. Most days will offer very low average prices, often clearly below one cent per kilowatt-hour. Exceptions will be **Monday** and especially **Wednesday**, when prices will temporarily rise higher than on other days.

On **Monday**, the average electricity price will be about 2.1 cents, but the most expensive moment will occur between 7 and 9 am, when the price will exceed 9 cents. This Monday morning price increase is explained by low wind power generation during the morning hours, as production sharply drops below one thousand megawatts.

The week's highest price spike will occur on **Wednesday**, between 7 and 9 am, when electricity prices are expected to momentarily exceed 13 cents. The high price expectation is clearly linked to significantly reduced wind power production, dropping to around 700 megawatts during morning hours. Wednesday's average price will nevertheless remain moderate, about 3.8 cents per kilowatt-hour.

On other days of the week, price developments will be particularly inexpensive. On **Tuesday**, **Thursday**, **Friday**, and **Saturday**, electricity prices will occasionally drop even into negative territory. On these days, the lowest hourly price will hover around negative one cent. Negative prices will also occur on **Sunday**, although the day's average price will be slightly higher, about 0.7 cents.

In the latter half of the week, especially on **Friday**, wind power will be at its strongest. Average wind power production on Friday will exceed 4000 megawatts, partly explaining the very low electricity price expectations for that day.

Overall, next week will provide electricity users with generally very affordable electricity prices. Aside from isolated higher price peaks occurring Wednesday and Monday morning, electricity will mostly be very inexpensive or even negatively priced.
