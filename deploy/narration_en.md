Next week's electricity price forecast will show significant day-to-day fluctuations. **Friday** and **Monday** will be public holidays, potentially reducing electricity demand compared to normal. This could partly contribute to negative prices during certain hours. On **Friday**, the lowest predicted price will be around -0.3 cents from 02:00 to 04:00 at night. Similarly, early in the morning on **Monday** from 02:00 to 04:00, prices could also dip slightly negative, with a forecasted minimum of -0.4 cents.

The week's lowest average price, around one cent, will occur on **Sunday**. Strong winds will significantly boost wind power generation, peaking above 4600 megawatts. Consequently, electricity prices will remain low throughout the day, with the lowest price forecasted at -1.7 cents between 05:00 and 07:00 in the morning.

Slightly higher price levels are forecasted for **Saturday** and **Tuesday**, with average prices around 6 to 7 cents. On Saturday morning between 08:00 and 10:00, the weekend's exceptional price peak will occur, when electricity prices rise above 12 cents. This will be associated with wind power temporarily dropping to around 500 megawatts. Tuesday's highest price, exceeding 13 cents per kilowatt-hour, will occur between 07:00 and 09:00 in the morning.

The week's highest average price, 7.4 cents, will occur on **Wednesday**. During the morning hours between 08:00 and 10:00, electricity prices will climb close to 15 cents. At the same time, wind power generation will drop temporarily to a relatively low level, around 900 megawatts. Wednesday also has a high risk of price spikes, with single-hour prices possibly surging to as much as 20â€“30 cents.

Finally, prices are expected to decline significantly again on **Thursday**. The average will fall below three cents, and there will be no risk of price spikes. Prices throughout the day will remain consistently low, with the highest price around seven cents immediately after midnight.
