The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is undergoing a maintenance outage which started on 1.3.2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on 2.5.2025 at 02:00. This outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data during such periods is limited.

Significant variation in electricity prices is expected during the upcoming week. Prices will be very affordable at the beginning of the week; on **Saturday** and **Sunday**, the average electricity price will remain slightly above one cent per kilowatt-hour, with negative hourly prices also occurring on both days. On **Monday**, the price level will continue to stay low, averaging around 1.5 cents, and prices will reach their lowest at night, dropping to as low as -1.4 cents per kilowatt-hour.

As the week progresses, electricity prices will start to rise. On **Tuesday**, the average price will climb to three cents, with the highest hourly price occurring in the morning between 8 and 10 a.m., reaching almost 12 cents per kilowatt-hour. This marks the week's first clear price increase, though no risk of price spikes has been forecasted for this day.

On **Wednesday**, the price level will rise further, averaging 4.6 cents for the day. Additionally, the risk of price spikes will increase, potentially pushing hourly prices up to 10 cents per kilowatt-hour during the morning hours of 7–9 a.m. On **Thursday**, the average price will slightly decrease to 3.7 cents, but the risk of price spikes will remain, again potentially reaching 10 cents during individual hours.

However, the most expensive day of the week will clearly be **Friday**, which is a public holiday. On this day, the average electricity price is expected to be 5.4 cents, with the highest hourly price occurring at 9 p.m., rising up to 13.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. Furthermore, Friday carries a notably high risk of price spikes, potentially reaching as high as 20 cents for individual hours. This is partly due to reduced electricity demand on the public holiday but also due to exceptionally low minimum wind power production, which drops below 700 megawatts on Friday.
