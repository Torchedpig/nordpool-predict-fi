Next week, electricity prices on the exchange market are expected to show considerable variation. Prices will be particularly high at the start of the week but are anticipated to decrease significantly toward Wednesday. Within the early part of the week, notable hourly price differences are forecast.

The highest daily average price of the week is expected on **Monday**, at 8.9 cents. Monday's peak prices will occur in the morning hours between 7‚Äì9, when the price will rise as high as 22.2 cents. This high price is associated with low wind power production, which will be around 1600 MW in the morning and as low as 746 MW at its lowest point during the day.

On **Tuesday**, prices will also be relatively high, with a daily average of 7.0 cents. Additionally, the forecast indicates a high risk of price spikes on Tuesday: individual hourly prices may reach as high as 20‚Äì30 cents. The forecasted maximum price is around 14.9 cents between 8‚Äì10 in the morning, but could be significantly higher if price spikes occur.

The situation will change dramatically on **Wednesday**, when the lowest prices of the week are anticipated. The average price for the day is forecast to be only 0.5 cents. During the early morning hours, the price will even become negative, reaching as low as -1.5 cents between 3‚Äì5 a.m. Wednesday‚Äôs low price is due to very high wind power production, averaging nearly 5900 MW.

On **Thursday** and **Friday**, prices will return to moderate levels. Thursday's average electricity price is forecast to be 4.6 cents, and Friday's 3.6 cents. However, both days carry a slight risk of price spikes, potentially pushing individual hourly prices up to around 10 cents.

Weekend days, **Saturday** and **Sunday**, will be very affordable in terms of electricity prices. Saturday's average price will be only 0.4 cents, and Sunday's 1.6 cents. Negative electricity prices will also occur during nighttime and early morning hours on both days. Prices over the weekend are expected to remain stable without spikes.
