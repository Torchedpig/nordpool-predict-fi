Electricity exchange prices will vary notably over the upcoming week. The week will start with very inexpensive electricity, as the average price on **Friday** will remain negative (-0.1 cents). Nighttime hourly prices will also dip below zero, reaching as low as -0.7 cents. Such low prices are explained by abundant wind power production, averaging around 4150 MW on Friday.

Prices will clearly rise over the weekend. On **Saturday**, the average price will slightly increase to 2.3 cents but will still remain modest. However, significantly higher prices are expected on **Sunday**, with the average price reaching 6.2 cents and a maximum price of 11.2 cents. Additionally, Sunday carries a notable risk of hourly price peaks of up to 20 cents. The highest hourly prices will occur in the evening between 19:00‚Äì21:00, when wind power production will drop to approximately 836 MW.

The new week starts with high prices. **Monday‚Äôs** average price is expected to be the highest of the week, at 7.8 cents, and the maximum price will reach 12.6 cents during the morning hours between 8:00‚Äì10:00. Monday also carries a significant risk of price spikes up to 20 cents per kilowatt-hour during certain hours. The rise in prices is partially explained by lower wind power production averaging around just 2060 MW.

As the week progresses, prices will stabilize noticeably. On **Tuesday**, the average price will again decrease to a modest level of 3.5 cents, and on Wednesday it will fall even below one cent (0.5 cents). Wednesday's exceptionally low prices are explained by particularly strong wind conditions, with average wind power production exceeding 5300 MW throughout the day.

Toward the end of the week, prices will rise slightly but remain affordable. On **Thursday**, the average price is forecast at around 4 cents. Prices will momentarily dip negative again during nighttime and early morning hours, but will peak between 8:00‚Äì10:00, reaching a maximum of 8.5 cents.
