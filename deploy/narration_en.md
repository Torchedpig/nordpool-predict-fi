During the upcoming week, electricity prices will experience moderate variation. The average price will remain clearly below five cents on each day. However, intraday price fluctuations will be noteworthy.

The most expensive day of the week will be **Friday**, when the average electricity price rises to 4,5 cents per kilowatt-hour. At its peak, the price on Friday will reach as high as 12,0 cents between 8â€“10 in the morning. On the same day, wind power production will be as low as 1327 megawatts, partially explaining the high morning price. Thus, Friday carries a risk of price spikes at individual hours.

On **Thursday** as well, electricity prices will display somewhat higher-than-average fluctuations, varying from -0,7 cents to 6,2 cents. Thursday is a public holiday, potentially reducing electricity demand. Despite this, the possibility of price spikes at individual hours exists.

In the early weekdays, prices will remain exceptionally low. Both **Monday** and **Tuesday** will see average electricity prices under one cent. Negative prices will even occur during the nighttime and early morning; for instance, on early Monday morning, the price will dip as low as -1,3 cents around 01:00â€“03:00.

Over the weekend, both **Saturday** and **Sunday** will offer affordable electricity, although on Sunday the price will momentarily rise above eight cents between 8â€“10 in the morning. On Saturday, price fluctuations will remain moderate, peaking at 2,4 cents and bottoming out negatively at -0,9 cents.

Overall, the week will offer relatively cheap electricity, but intraday price variations suggest paying closer attention to hourly forecasts.
