*Electricity prices will fluctuate significantly in the coming week: early in the week, notable price spikes will occur, particularly on Monday and Tuesday, while towards the weekend, abundant wind power production will push prices down, even into negative territory.*

The Olkiluoto 1 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The maintenance began on May 11, 2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on May 22, 2025 at 18:00. The maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the forecast since training data during maintenance periods is limited.

In the coming week, the forecasted electricity prices will differ considerably from day to day. Especially on **Monday**, electricity prices will reach the week's highest level. The average price is forecasted at 8.9 cents per kilowatt-hour, and the maximum price may exceed 22 cents. The price peak is expected to occur between 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning. This high maximum price is partly due to exceptionally low wind power production on Monday morning, momentarily dropping to just 189 MW. This low wind power production also increases the risk of hourly price spikes on Monday.

On **Tuesday**, the prices will significantly drop compared to Monday. The average price will settle around five cents, but the forecast still indicates possible price spikes between 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning, when the maximum price could exceed 16 cents. This again is explained by low wind power generation in the morning, briefly falling below 800 MW.

From **Wednesday** onward, prices will decrease markedly. Wednesday's average price will be below one cent, and negative prices may occur during night hours. This is due to very strong winds, keeping wind power production consistently high throughout the day, even exceeding 4,400 MW. Prices on Thursday and Friday will also remain moderate, supported by fairly abundant wind power production.

Over the weekend, prices are expected to decrease further, and electricity prices on **Saturday** and **Sunday** may even average negative. Sunday's average price is the lowest of the week at -0.4 cents. The low weekend prices result from particularly abundant wind power production, maintaining high electricity generation and thus lowering prices.

Thus, the week will be characterized by early-week price spikes and exceptionally low or even negative prices towards the weekend.
