During the upcoming week, electricity prices in Finland will mostly remain very affordable. Average daily prices will stay close to zero or even negative on most days. The largest intra-day price variation will occur on **Tuesday**, when prices briefly rise above eight cents between 8:00 and 10:00, peaking at 12,6 cents around 9:00. This price spike coincides with the lowest wind power generation at 585 MW. For the rest of the day, prices will hover close to zero, dipping slightly negative (-0,6 ¢) at 23:00.

The cheapest day of the week will be **Thursday**, with an average electricity price clearly negative at -0,7 cents. Early Thursday morning between 3:00 and 6:00, electricity prices will reach their lowest point at around -2,3 cents. Thursday’s low pricing can be largely explained by exceptionally abundant wind power generation, consistently high throughout the day at 2820–5879 MW.

On **Wednesday**, **Friday**, **Saturday**, and **Monday**, electricity prices will remain very close to zero. These days will not see significant price fluctuations, with prices staying consistently low. Most hours during these days will be either free or negatively priced. Wind power production will be moderately high or high, helping maintain low prices.

Weekend pricing will remain particularly stable. On **Saturday**, electricity will be nearly free throughout the entire day, peaking at only 0,7 cents. On **Sunday**, the average price will also be practically zero, although there is a small risk of occasional price spikes. On Sunday morning between 7:00 and 9:00, prices will briefly approach two cents.

Overall, the coming week provides electricity consumers an excellent opportunity to benefit from low electricity prices. Higher price peaks will only be seen briefly on Tuesday morning and Sunday morning.
