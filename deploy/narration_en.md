*The upcoming week begins with high electricity prices and a risk of price spikes, but strong wind power production later in the week will push prices extremely low, even negative; the maintenance outage at Olkiluoto 3 could affect forecast accuracy.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently experiencing a maintenance outage, which began on 1 March 2025 at 03:00 and is expected to conclude on 2 May 2025 at 02:00. The outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data from outage periods is limited.

Forecast updated on Saturday at 21:00.

The electricity price forecast for the upcoming week shows a clear downward trend. The week will start with relatively high prices, but towards the end of the week, prices will drop significantly, becoming extremely affordable and occasionally even negative.

The highest prices will be seen on **Monday**, with an average price of 11.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. Throughout the day, prices will range between 4.1 and 20.5 cents. During certain individual hours, particularly around 9 AM to 1 PM and again around 7‚Äì9 PM, there will be a significant risk of price spikes, possibly rising as high as 30‚Äì50 cents. This spike risk is associated with notably weak wind power production, averaging slightly above 550 megawatts throughout the day and dropping to as low as 211 megawatts.

On **Tuesday**, the price level will decrease somewhat from Monday, with an average price around 7.6 cents. However, there remains a risk of price spikes on isolated hours, with potential peaks up to around 20 cents. Significant fluctuations in wind power throughout the day will partly explain these variations.

Starting from Wednesday, prices will clearly decrease. On **Thursday**, the average price will be as low as 2.3 cents, with the day's lowest hourly price slightly below zero. From Friday through Sunday, prices will remain very low, with negative hourly prices occurring frequently. The week's lowest hourly price, -1.7 cents, will occur around 5 PM on **Saturday**.

The exceptionally low prices in the latter half of the week will largely be explained by strong wind power production, maintaining very high levels from Thursday to Sunday. Average wind power will surpass 4000 megawatts, reaching over 5800 megawatts on **Friday**. This abundant wind power supply will push electricity prices downward, ensuring very affordable price levels towards the end of the week.
