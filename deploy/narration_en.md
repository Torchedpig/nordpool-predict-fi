The price of electricity on the exchange will be volatile in the coming week. The average price for the week is expected to be around seven cents. At the beginning of the week, electricity will be cheap, but **Wednesday** will be the most expensive day by far. The average price on Wednesday will rise to about 10 cents per kilowatt-hour, and the highest price of the day could rise above 15 cents.

On Wednesday, **Thursday**, and **Saturday**, there is a risk that the prices for individual hours will rise to as much as 20-40 cents per kilowatt-hour. Such high price spikes would most likely occur during the morning hours of 7-9, or in the early evening between 5 PM and 7 PM. A slightly lower price spike of around 20 cents is forecast for Friday and Sunday.

Towards the end of the week, average prices will remain high, but will decrease slightly from the middle of the week. The average price on Saturday could rise to close to 10 cents, but on **Sunday** the price will fall again. During Sunday, the price will decrease towards the evening, and in the evening the price could be even less than five cents per kilowatt-hour.

Wind power production will be abundant at the beginning of the week, which explains the cheap prices. However, from Wednesday onwards, wind power production will decrease significantly, and on Thursday, according to the forecast, very little wind power will be available. The lowest wind power production on Thursday will remain at only about 660 megawatts. On Saturday, wind power will be scarce, averaging less than 1400 megawatts.

During the week, temperatures will remain around zero or slightly below freezing. On Sunday, the temperature will drop to -1.5 degrees Celsius.
