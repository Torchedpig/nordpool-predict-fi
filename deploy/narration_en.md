Electricity price expectations will vary during the coming week. Next **Monday**, the price is expected to be higher than on other days. The average price for Monday is estimated to be 12.3 ¬¢/kWh, and the highest price of the day could rise to 18.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. There is also a high risk of price spikes on Monday, with prices for individual hours potentially reaching 30-50 cents.

Monday's high price level is partly explained by the fact that wind power is predicted to be exceptionally low, only 693-1464 MW.

Based on the hourly forecast, the price spike is expected to occur between 8 and 10 am.

On **Sunday**, the average price of electricity on the power exchange is expected to be 7.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. The price will be at its lowest during the first hours of the early morning, when it could fall as low as 0.2 cents. There is a high risk of price spikes on Sunday. Prices for individual hours could rise as high as 20-30 cents per kilowatt-hour.

Next **Tuesday**, the average price of electricity on the power exchange is estimated to be 6.2 ¬¢/kWh. Tuesday's highest price could rise to 11.5 cents, but the lowest price of the day will remain at 2.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. There is a risk of price spikes on Tuesday, with prices for individual hours potentially reaching 20 cents per kilowatt-hour.

An average price of 8.3 cents is forecast for next **Friday**. There is a risk of price spikes on Friday. Prices for individual hours could rise as high as 20 cents per kilowatt-hour. The price spike is estimated to occur during the morning hours, approximately between 7 and 9 am.

Next **Saturday**, the price of electricity on the power exchange is expected to be the lowest of the week, with an average price of 4.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. Saturday's lowest price could even reach -0.2 cents per kilowatt-hour, which would mean a negative price.
