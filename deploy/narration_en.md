*In the upcoming week, electricity prices will decrease day by day: early in the week, significant price variations and risks of price spikes are expected, but by the weekend, prices will become very affordable, even negative, as abundant wind power generation significantly lowers market electricity prices.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is undergoing a maintenance outage, which began on 1.3.2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on 29.4.2025 at 01:00. The maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of this forecast since limited historical data is available during maintenance periods.

In the coming week, the electricity market prices will differ significantly from day to day. Prices will decrease noticeably as the week progresses. The beginning of the week will be the most expensive, while towards the end of the week electricity prices will become substantially cheaper. During the weekend, negative prices will even occur.

Clearly, the most expensive day of the week will be **Monday**, with an average price of 5.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. Monday will also feature large price variations: at the cheapest hours, electricity will cost slightly over one cent, but at the highest, prices will rise close to 15 cents between 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning. Additionally, there is a forecasted risk of price spikes on Monday, potentially pushing hourly prices up to 20 ¬¢. This is partly due to low wind power production in the morning, occasionally dropping to around 1000 MW.

On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, the price situation will stabilize somewhat. Average prices will stay below four cents, but single-hour spikes are still possible, with prices potentially reaching up to approximately 10 cents. On Wednesday morning, especially between 7:00 and 9:00, prices may peak around 10 cents, making these hours more expensive than the rest of the day.

**Thursday** is a public holiday, reducing electricity demand compared to typical weekdays. This will be reflected in a very moderate average price‚Äîonly 1.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. Price variation on Thursday will still be substantial: at the lowest point, electricity will even have a negative price (-0.5 ¬¢), while in the morning between 8:00 and 10:00, it will briefly rise slightly above five cents.

Over the weekend, particularly on **Saturday** and **Sunday**, the electricity price forecast is very affordable. Prices will remain close to zero or even negative most of the time. On Sunday, wind power production is forecasted to be exceptionally abundant, reaching nearly 5000 MW. This abundant wind generation explains the weekend's low electricity prices.
