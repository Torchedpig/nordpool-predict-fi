*Electricity prices for the upcoming week will be very low, even negative during the weekend, but prices will rise significantly on Wednesday and Thursday, with Thursday also carrying a risk of high price spikes as Olkiluoto 3 remains under maintenance.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage, which began on 1 March 2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on 2 May 2025 at 02:00. This maintenance outage may affect forecast accuracy, as training data from outage periods is limited.

In the upcoming week, electricity prices will vary notably from day to day. During the weekend, prices will remain very low, with average prices close to zero. On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, electricity prices will even become negative at certain hours. For example, during the nights leading into **Saturday** and **Sunday**, prices will drop as low as -1.1 and -1.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. The daily average prices will stand at -0.1 and 0.1 cents.

Thus, the week's cheapest prices will occur over the weekend. This will be partly due to abundant wind power production, which maintains a high supply and pushes prices downward.

As the week progresses, however, prices will rise. On **Monday** and **Tuesday**, average prices will settle at a moderate level slightly below three cents. Both days will experience relatively high-priced periods during the morning hours. On **Monday**, the highest hourly price, 8.5 cents, will occur between 8:00–10:00. Similarly, on **Tuesday**, the peak price of 8.8 cents will occur around 9:00 in the morning. The price increase on these days relates to lower wind power production during morning hours.

The week's most expensive days will be **Wednesday** and **Thursday**, when average prices will be notably higher compared to early in the week. On **Wednesday**, the average price will rise to 6.9 cents, with peak hourly prices exceeding 12 cents during the evening between 19:00–21:00. On **Thursday**, the price will continue to rise, reaching the week's highest average price at 7.7 cents. On Thursday, prices will peak during evening hours around 19:00–21:00, exceeding 11 cents. Additionally, Thursday carries a forecasted risk of price spikes reaching as high as 20 cents during individual hours. Thursday's elevated prices are partly explained by exceptionally low wind power production, averaging below 1500 MW.

On **Friday**, prices will again decline to a moderate level. The daily average will settle slightly below four cents, and the highest hourly prices during the day will remain below seven cents.
