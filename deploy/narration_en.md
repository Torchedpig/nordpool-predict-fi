The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance, which began on March 1, 2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on April 28, 2025 at 01:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as limited training data is available for periods with nuclear maintenance outages.

Electricity price forecasts for the week ahead show significant variation. **Thursday** will clearly stand out as the most expensive day, with an average price of 15.9 cents per kilowatt-hour. The intra-day price variation on Thursday will be large; at its lowest, electricity will cost around three cents early in the night, but prices will rise steeply above 30 cents between 7:00 and 9:00 in the morning. Individual hourly price spikes may even surpass the forecast, potentially reaching between 40 and 60 cents per kilowatt-hour. Low wind power production in the morning partly explains Thursday's high price peaks.

On **Friday**, the average price will decrease slightly to around 12.1 cents. The most expensive hours will again occur between 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning, when prices may momentarily rise to 30â€“50 cents. Friday's minimum wind power production will be only 280 MW, clearly contributing to the high price peaks during morning hours.

The weekend will bring clear relief in prices. On **Saturday**, the average price will drop significantly to a very low level of 3.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. Overnight into Saturday, electricity prices will even briefly dip into negative territory, reaching as low as -0.5 cents. Strong winds and high wind power production averaging over 3000 MW will support Saturday's low prices. Saturday's peak prices will remain moderate, although single-hour spikes of around 10 cents could still occur.

On **Sunday**, prices will remain moderate, averaging about 6.2 cents. Price fluctuations will be less pronounced than on preceding days, though individual hours may still rise to about 20 cents. Wind power production will remain at normal levels on Sunday and will not cause significant price changes.

At the beginning of the new week, on **Monday**, higher prices are expected again. The week's first weekday will have an average price of approximately 10.9 cents. Monday morning hours will be the most expensive, and individual price spikes could rise to 30â€“40 cents. Wind power production on Monday will remain relatively low, partly explaining the higher price peaks.

Towards mid-next week, on **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, prices will settle to more moderate levels. Tuesday's average price will be around eight cents, while Wednesday's will be slightly below eight cents. However, especially on Wednesday, individual hourly price spikes may rise to 20â€“30 cents, partly due to low wind power production.
