*Electricity prices will remain mostly affordable during the upcoming week, but Wednesday morning will experience the week's highest peak, exceeding 13 cents. On other days, prices will occasionally drop into negative territory, particularly during early morning hours, driven by abundant wind power production.*

The Olkiluoto 1 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage. The outage began on 11.5.2025 at 18:00 and is estimated to end on 22.5.2025 at 18:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data from periods of nuclear plant outages is limited.

The forecast was last updated on Sunday at 14:23.

Next week's electricity price forecast shows variability, especially within individual days. The week will start with relatively low prices, but prices forecasted for Wednesday will temporarily rise significantly. Otherwise, average weekly prices will largely remain around one cent or below.

On **Monday**, prices will vary considerably; at their lowest, they will be around 0.6 cents during the night, but between 7:00 and 9:00 in the morning they will rise above 7 cents, peaking at 9.3 ¢. Despite this, Monday's average will remain affordable, slightly over two cents.

On **Tuesday**, negative hourly prices are expected, dropping as low as -1.0 ¢ during early morning hours between 3:00 and 5:00. The day's average price will remain below half a cent. On **Wednesday**, the situation will change briefly: prices between 7:00 and 9:00 in the morning will increase significantly, peaking at 13.2 cents, the highest single-hour price of the week. This price peak is partially explained by low wind power production, which will dip below a thousand megawatts in the morning. Wednesday's average price will be the week's highest at 3.1 cents, but still affordable overall.

On Thursday and Friday, wind power production will be abundant, exceeding an average of 3000 megawatts. This will reflect in both days' very low average prices, around half a cent. Both days will also experience negative hourly prices: Thursday as low as -0.4 ¢ and Friday as low as -0.8 ¢ during early morning hours.

Prices on Saturday and Sunday will remain low, though Sunday includes a forecasted risk of individual price spikes. On Sunday morning and afternoon, negative hourly prices are also expected, dropping as low as -1.1 ¢. Nevertheless, Sunday's average price will remain below one cent, even though prices may momentarily rise during individual hours.

Wednesday morning's price peak clearly stands out in the week's price development, but overall, the week will remain affordable for consumers. However, the nuclear maintenance outage at Olkiluoto 1 could affect the accuracy of the forecast, and actual prices may deviate from predictions.
