The electricity price forecast for the coming week shows varying figures. Prices will rise to their highest at the end of the week, but will fall again after the weekend.

On **Tuesday**, the average price of electricity will be 3.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. The prices of individual hours will vary from -0.3 cents to 11.4 cents. Tuesday's low prices are explained by abundant wind power, which is forecast to rise to over 6000 megawatts during the day. At night and early in the morning, electricity will be almost free, but in the evening the price will rise.

From Wednesday to Friday, the price of electricity will be significantly higher. **Wednesday's** average price will be 10.2 ¢, **Thursday's** 10.9 ¢, and **Friday's** 10.4 ¢. On these days, wind power production will remain clearly lower than on Tuesday, and there is also a risk that the prices of individual hours could rise up to 30-40 cents per kilowatt-hour. The price peak is most likely to occur on Thursday morning, around 8-10 am. On Friday, the peak is likely to be in the early evening, around 6-8 pm.

On **Saturday**, the average price will fall to 8.6 cents, but there is still a risk that price spikes of up to 20-40 cents may occur during individual hours. On **Sunday**, the average price will fall to 6.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Sunday, more wind power will be available again, but even then there is a risk of 20-cent price spikes.

Next **Monday**, the price of electricity will return to an affordable level, with an average price of 4.1 ¢/kWh. Wind power will again be abundant, and no significant price spikes are expected in Monday's forecast.
