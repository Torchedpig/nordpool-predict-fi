In the upcoming week, electricity prices will vary considerably. The week will begin with two holidays, **Sunday** and **Monday**, which will reduce electricity demand and keep prices moderate. On Sunday, the average daily price will hover around one cent, with the lowest hourly prices even turning negative. On Monday, the average price will stay around two cents, with moderate price fluctuations.

The situation will change markedly on **Tuesday**, when prices will rise significantly. The day's average price will climb above seven cents, with particularly high hourly prices in the morning and especially in the evening. Between 20:00 and 22:00, prices could rise up to 16 cents. Additionally, Tuesday carries a significant risk of price spikes, during which individual hourly prices could soar as high as 20–30 cents.

On **Wednesday**, prices will remain elevated, although the average price will drop noticeably from Tuesday to around five cents. Price fluctuations will still be considerable, and Wednesday will also carry a risk of price spikes, with temporary peaks possibly reaching up to 20 cents. The highest prices will occur around morning and evening hours.

On **Thursday**, **Friday**, and **Saturday**, prices will stabilize somewhat, but fluctuations will remain noticeable. Thursday's average price will be below four cents, but on Friday the maximum price could exceed ten cents. Saturday will again offer cheaper hours, with the day's lowest prices dropping into negative territory. However, even these days may see occasional price spikes reaching up to 10 cents.

The week will end similarly to Sunday, with lower price levels. Users should, however, be particularly aware of price fluctuations on Tuesday and Wednesday. The risk of significant price spikes on these days could impact electricity consumption planning.
