Electricity price developments for the coming week appear variable, especially at the start of the weekend and at the very end of the week. **Friday** and **Saturday** stand out with the highest average prices, both around eight cents. On both days, peak hourly prices exceed 16 ¢, with **Friday’s** top reaching 19.3 ¢ between 8–10 a.m. Wind power production remains weak during both days, especially in the morning and evening hours, which explains the higher maximum prices.

Both **Saturday** and **Monday** are forecast to have a high risk of hourly price spikes. Saturday’s clearest spike occurs in the morning between 8–10 a.m., when the price hits 16 ¢, despite a more moderate daily average. A similar risk repeats on **Monday**, with the highest hourly prices expected between 8–11 a.m., reaching 14.9 ¢. During these hours, wind power generation drops well below one thousand megawatts.

**Sunday** is a public holiday, and energy demand is expected to be lower. This is reflected in a daily average price of 5.2 ¢, with a modest maximum of just 9.7 ¢. However, there is a noted risk of hourly price spikes, with the highest hourly price falling between 6–8 a.m. Wind power production on Sunday varies, but occasionally falls very low, which lifts some hourly prices.

As the week progresses, **Tuesday** and **Wednesday** see average prices settle around six cents, with daily maximums well below the weekend’s highs. Hourly price fluctuations continue, and brief increases are possible during the mornings and early evenings. The week’s most notable change appears on **Thursday**, when the average price drops to 1.8 ¢ and the lowest hourly price reaches -0.1 ¢. On Thursday, wind power production rises to a very high level, pushing electricity prices down throughout the day.

Overall, the coming week’s highest hourly prices are forecast for the mornings of **Friday** and **Saturday**, while the lowest prices will occur on Thursday morning, when the price briefly turns negative. Price variation is particularly pronounced around the weekend, and clear spikes are predicted for certain hours, especially when wind power generation is at its lowest.
