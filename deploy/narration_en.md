*Electricity prices for the coming week will vary by day: Monday will see a distinct price peak, while towards the end of the week, prices will dip occasionally into negative territory thanks to strong wind power production. However, price spikes may occur during individual hours, especially early in the week.*

Electricity prices for the coming week will vary significantly depending on the day. The general price level will remain affordable, but **Monday** clearly stands out as the most expensive day. Monday's average price will rise to 9,6 cents per kilowatt-hour, and individual hours may peak at over 24 cents. Especially during the morning hours from 8‚Äì10 am, electricity prices may climb exceptionally high.

On **Sunday**, electricity prices are expected to remain moderate, with the daily average around three cents. However, there is a risk of price spikes during individual hours, especially in the morning from 8‚Äì10 am. The minimum electricity prices on Sunday might even reach close to zero.

On **Tuesday**, prices will again drop to affordable levels, with an average price below four cents. Despite the generally low price level, individual hours might experience price spikes, especially in the morning between 8‚Äì10 am.

From **Wednesday** onwards, electricity prices will be very low. According to forecasts, Wednesday and Thursday will see several hours when prices become negative, meaning consumers could theoretically earn money for electricity usage. On both days, the average price remains below one cent, making them the cheapest days of the week.

On **Friday** and **Saturday**, the price level continues to be very affordable. Prices will fluctuate only slightly, and no significant price spikes are expected on either day. Even on Saturday, individual negative price hours are forecast, making consumption especially affordable during these times.

On days with low average prices, particularly midweek, the drop in electricity price is explained by strong wind power production. From Wednesday to Friday, wind power generation will be exceptionally abundant, keeping prices low. Conversely, Monday's higher price is clearly explained by significantly lower wind power output, potentially causing prices to rise, especially during morning peak consumption hours.
