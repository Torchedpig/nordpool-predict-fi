The coming week looks twofold in terms of electricity prices. Price expectations vary considerably between different days. Electricity will be most expensive on **Friday**, when the average daily price will rise to 8.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. The maximum price for Friday is forecast at 14.2 ¢, but during individual hours the price may rise up to 20 cents. The price peak is likely to occur in the afternoon and early evening, around 4-6 PM. The higher prices on Friday are explained by low wind power generation. Wind power will be available on Friday at an average of only 2039 MW, and the minimum daily production will remain at 1448 MW.

On **Saturday**, there is also not much wind power available, as the average wind power production remains at 2452 MW. Saturday's average price is 6.4 ¢/kWh, but like Friday, there is a risk of price spikes on Saturday, and the price of electricity can rise up to 20 cents during individual hours. Saturday's price peak will most likely occur in the early evening, around 5-7 PM.

On **Sunday**, the price of electricity will fall to a significantly lower level, 3.9 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Sunday, there will be plenty of wind power available, an average of 4661 MW.

Next **Monday**, electricity will be even cheaper than Sunday, with an average price of only 2.7 ¢/kWh. On Monday, there will be a very large amount of wind power available, an average of 5286 MW.

Next **Tuesday** and next **Wednesday**, the price of electricity will continue to decline. Tuesday's average price is forecast at 1.8 ¢ and Wednesday's at 2.0 ¢. On Tuesday, it is even possible that the price of electricity will temporarily fall into negative territory during the early morning hours. There will be a very large amount of wind power available on both Tuesday and Wednesday, over 5000 MW on average.
