The price of exchange electricity will remain mostly affordable or moderate during the coming week. The most expensive day will be **Friday**, when the average price will rise to 9.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. Friday's maximum price, 13.6 ¢, is significantly higher than on other days.

However, on **Thursday** and Friday, there is a risk of higher price spikes than predicted. On Thursday, the prices of individual hours may rise up to 20-30 cents, and on Friday up to 20 cents. The most likely time for the spikes is in the morning between 7-9 AM and in the evening between 5-7 PM. The risk of price spikes is partly due to the fact that wind power production will remain at a low level on Thursday and Friday. On Thursday, the minimum wind power available will be only 1501 MW and on Friday 1462 MW.

From Saturday onwards, the price of exchange electricity will fall significantly, and the weekend is expected to be cheap. The average price for **Saturday** is forecast to be 5.5 ¢/kWh, and the average price for **Sunday** will fall further to 4.0 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Sunday, the price of electricity will fall below one cent (0.9 ¢/kWh) in the early morning. The low prices on Sunday are explained by the very abundant wind power production, as wind power will be available on Sunday at an average of 4285 MW.

Next **Monday** and **Tuesday**, electricity will be even cheaper. The average price for Monday is expected to be 2.9 ¢ and for Tuesday only 1.9 ¢. On Tuesday, the price of electricity may even temporarily drop to zero. On Monday and Tuesday, wind power will be very abundant, averaging over 5000 MW.

Next **Wednesday**, the average price of exchange electricity will remain low, at 2.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. Wednesday's price expectations are very similar to Tuesday's, although wind power production is forecast to decline somewhat.
