*Next week, spot electricity prices are expected to remain mostly moderate, though isolated hours may see possible price spikes. On Sunday, electricity could be exceptionally inexpensive, while on other days prices are forecast to fluctuate somewhat more.*

A production shortfall is currently ongoing at the Loviisa 2 nuclear power plant. The plant's nominal output is 248.0 MW, but only 3 MW are currently available, resulting in an operating rate of just 1.2 percent. The shortfall began on 4.5.2025 at 17:00 and is expected to end on 6.5.2025 at 20:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as there is only limited training data available for periods with nuclear maintenance.

The forecast was updated on Monday at 14:23.

Spot electricity prices for the coming week are expected to remain mainly moderate. Throughout the week, average prices will range from below one cent up to around four cents. The lowest prices are forecast for Sunday, when the average price will remain under one cent and some hours may even see negative prices. On Sunday, electricity demand is expected to be lower than usual, explaining the low price level.

The highest hourly prices are forecast for Tuesday and Thursday, when the maximum price will rise above nine cents, possibly reaching ten cents during individual hours. On these days, minimum wind power production will drop clearly below 2000 MW, which increases the spot price particularly during the morning hours (8:00–10:00 on Tuesday and Thursday). On other days, wind power fluctuations are more moderate, but there is also a noted risk of individual price spikes on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, when prices could temporarily reach up to 10 cents.

Friday’s average price will rise slightly above four cents, but intraday price fluctuations are expected to remain modest. Saturday and Monday are also expected to see moderate average prices, but even on these days there is a risk of short-term price spikes. On Saturday, the highest prices are anticipated in the evening, and on Monday during the late morning.

The lowest prices of the week are expected for Sunday afternoon and early evening, when electricity prices may drop below zero. The highest single-hour prices are forecast for Tuesday and Thursday mornings, but possible price spikes could also occur on other days, such as Wednesday and Friday, especially during morning and evening hours.
