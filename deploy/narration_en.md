The price of exchange electricity will vary considerably in the coming days. On **Friday**, the price will be significantly higher, and the average price for the day is expected to be as high as 10.0 ¬¢/kWh. Friday's maximum price, 18.1 ¬¢/kWh, will be between nine in the morning and five in the afternoon (8-10 am). It should also be noted that prices for individual hours could rise to as much as 20-40 cents, as a high risk of price spikes has been forecast for Friday. The risk of price spikes is related to low wind power: during the day, only 545 MW - 4927 MW of wind power is expected to be available.

On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, the price of electricity will already be significantly cheaper. The average price for Saturday is expected to be 2.0 ¬¢/kWh and for Sunday only 1.7 ¬¢/kWh. On both days, the price will even dip below zero: on Saturday for one hour (at 5 pm) and on Sunday for two hours (2-4 pm). On Saturday, there will be a very large supply of wind power, with an average of 5188 MW. Even on Sunday, wind power will be available at an average of 4345 MW.

Next **Monday**, the average price of electricity will be just under four cents per kilowatt-hour. Monday's highest price, 6.3 ¬¢/kWh, will be in the evening (around 7-9 pm). On **Tuesday**, the average price of exchange electricity will be 3.4 cents, and the highest price of the day, 7.2 ¬¢/kWh, will be in the morning (around 7-9 am). On both days, there will be plenty of wind power available.

Next **Wednesday**, electricity will be cheap again, with an average price of only 1.9 ¬¢. Wednesday's lowest prices, below one cent, will be in the early morning hours (around 0-6 am). Next **Thursday**, the average price will rise to 4.2 cents. Wind power will be available on Thursday significantly less than on other days, which partly explains the higher price level. On Thursday, the minimum wind power production will be below 2000 MW, which may increase the price.
