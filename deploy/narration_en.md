Electricity prices on the power exchange will vary significantly between different days in the coming week. The week's price development will begin with high peak prices on Monday. On **Monday**, the average price will settle at 4.7 cents, but the most expensive moment of the day is expected in the morning between 07:00 and 09:00, when prices are forecast to rise as high as 13.7 cents. This is due to particularly low wind power production, which will reach its minimum of just 356 MW precisely in the morning. The risk of price spikes on individual hours will be high on Monday.

On **Tuesday**, prices will decrease considerably. The day's average price will stay below one cent, and during the overnight hours, electricity will even be available at negative prices, down to -0.4 cents. However, there is still a risk of price spikes on individual hours on Tuesday.

On **Wednesday**, electricity prices will rise again. The average price will be 3.2 cents, but a morning price spike between 07:00 and 09:00 could drive prices above 15 cents. This again is largely due to exceptionally low wind power production in the morning hours, with a minimum of only 648 MW. There will be a clear risk of price spikes on Wednesday.

The remainder of the week looks very affordable on the electricity market. On **Thursday**, **Friday**, and **Saturday**, electricity average prices will remain clearly below one cent. Moreover, during these days, electricity will occasionally be available at negative prices, reaching as low as -0.7 cents on Friday and even -1.2 cents on Saturday. These days will see high levels of wind power production, especially on Friday, when production is expected to reach up to 5060 MW at its peak.

**Sunday** will continue the weekend's moderate price level with an average price of only 0.6 cents. During the day, the week's cheapest moment is forecast: between 14:00 and 16:00, electricity prices will drop to -2.0 cents. However, there will still be a small risk of price spikes on individual hours on Sunday.
