The price expectations for exchange electricity will vary significantly during the coming week. At the beginning of the week, prices will be higher, but towards the end of the week, the price level will fall significantly.

On **Monday**, the average price of electricity will be 15.8 Â¢/kWh, which is the highest figure for the whole week. The highest price on Monday is expected to be 21.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. A high risk of price spikes is also forecast for Monday, with prices for individual hours potentially rising to 40-60 cents. The most likely time for a price spike is in the evening, around 5-7 PM.

On **Tuesday**, the average price of electricity is expected to be 11.2 Â¢/kWh. Tuesday's predicted maximum price is 15.9 Â¢, but there is also a high risk of price spikes on Tuesday. Prices for individual hours could rise to as much as 30-40 cents per kilowatt-hour.

On **Wednesday**, the average price is expected to be 12.3 Â¢/kWh, and the highest price is estimated to rise to 18.0 cents. A high risk of price spikes is also forecast for Wednesday, up to 30-50 cents per kilowatt-hour. The possibility of price spikes is likely to occur in the early evening, around 5-7 PM.

Next **Thursday**, the average price will fall to 9.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. The highest price on Thursday will remain at 14.2 cents, according to the forecast, but even then there is a high risk that prices for individual hours could rise to 20-40 cents per kilowatt-hour.

On **Friday**, the price of electricity will clearly decline. The average price for Friday is expected to be 3.8 Â¢/kWh, and the highest price of the day will remain at 6.3 cents. The lowest price on Friday is expected to be only 1.8 Â¢ per kilowatt-hour.

At the weekend, electricity will be cheap. On **Saturday**, the average price is forecast to be 2.5 Â¢/kWh and on **Sunday** 2.9 Â¢/kWh. The lowest hourly price on Saturday is expected to be close to zero, only 0.1 Â¢/kWh. The lowest price on Sunday is expected to be 0.6 Â¢.

Looking at the price level for the whole week, it can be noted that the days at the beginning of the week are clearly more expensive than the days at the end of the week. The high prices at the beginning of the week are partly explained by low temperatures, which increase electricity consumption. In addition, wind power production is forecast to be lower during the early part of the week, which also contributes to higher prices.
