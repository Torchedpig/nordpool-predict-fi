The electricity price expectations for the coming week vary considerably. There will be both more expensive and cheaper days.

On **Friday** and **Saturday**, the average prices of electricity will settle at 8.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. Friday's maximum price may rise to 15 cents and Saturday's to 14.6 cents. On both days, there is a risk that the prices of individual hours will rise significantly higher than predicted. On Friday, the price spike could rise up to 40 cents, and on Saturday to 20 cents. Price spikes are likely to occur in the evening, around 6-8 PM. Prices will be at their lowest during the night and early morning hours.

On **Sunday**, the price of electricity will fall significantly. The average price for the day is expected to be 3.3 ¢, and the cheapest hours of the day will be late at night, when the price may fall as low as 0.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. During Sunday, there will be plenty of wind power available, which explains the affordable price level.

Next **Monday** and **Tuesday**, electricity prices will continue to decline. The average price for Monday is predicted to be 3.0 ¢, and the average price for Tuesday is only 1.4 ¢. On Tuesday night, the price may even go down to -0.3 cents. On both days, a very large amount of wind power will be available, which will keep prices down.

Next **Wednesday**, the price will turn to a slight increase again, and the average price will settle at 2.1 cents per kilowatt-hour. However, the prices of individual hours will remain moderate. Next **Thursday**, the average price will rise to 4.9 cents, and the highest price of the day may be 12.4 ¢. On Thursday, there is also a risk that the prices of individual hours will rise higher than predicted, up to 10 cents. This is because the minimum wind power production on Thursday will be clearly lower than on other days.
