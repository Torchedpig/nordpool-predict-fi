Next week, the price expectations for electricity on the exchange will vary considerably. There will be both very expensive and very cheap days.

Electricity is expected to be most expensive on **Monday**, when the average daily price will rise to 16.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. Monday's highest price, 23.3 ¢, will be in the evening between 6 and 8 PM. On Monday, there is also a risk that the prices of individual hours will rise to as much as 40-60 cents. This is because wind power is forecast to be weak, at a minimum of only 218 MW.

There is also a high risk of price spikes on **Tuesday**, **Wednesday** and **Thursday**. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the prices of individual hours may rise to 30-50 cents and on Thursday to 20-40 cents. Tuesday's highest price, 17.4 ¢, is likely to be in the morning between 8 and 10 AM. Wednesday's highest price, 17.7 ¢, will be at the same hours. Thursday's highest price, 14.3 ¢, will also fall during the morning hours.

The fluctuation in prices is affected by large variations in wind power production. In addition to Monday, wind power will be least available on Wednesday and Thursday. On all three days, the minimum wind power production will remain below one thousand megawatts.

Towards the end of the week, the price of electricity will fall significantly. On **Friday** and **Saturday**, electricity will already be very cheap, as the average daily prices will fall below four cents. The night between Friday and Saturday will be a particularly cheap time, as hourly prices will fall to less than one cent on Saturday night. On Friday and Saturday, there will be plenty of wind power available, which explains the low prices.

It will be quite cold throughout the week, as the average daily temperatures will mostly remain well below freezing. Only on Saturday will the temperature rise slightly above zero.
