The price of exchange electricity will rise next week. Price expectations are low on **Sunday**, when the average price for the day is predicted to be 4.6 ¢. After Sunday, average prices will rise, and the week as a whole will be expensive.

On **Monday**, the average price of exchange electricity is expected to settle at 5.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. The prices of individual hours will vary from 0.9 cents to 7.2 cents. At night, the price will fall close to zero, but towards the evening the price will rise.

On **Thursday**, the average price will rise further, to 10.8 cents. Thursday is the second most expensive day of the week, and large fluctuations within the day are also predicted for Thursday. Prices will vary from 4.1 cents to 19.5 cents. Wind power will be scarce at times on Thursday, only 948 MW, which partly explains the high price.

On **Friday**, the average price of exchange electricity will be the highest of the week, 12.4 ¢. Friday's price range is 7.3 - 17.9 ¢. Wind power production will remain low on Friday, which will increase the price. In addition, freezing temperatures of -5.6 degrees are forecast for Friday, which will further increase the demand for electricity and raise the price. On Friday, there is also a high risk that the prices of individual hours will rise to 30-50 cents, especially in the morning between 7 AM and 9 AM and in the evening between 5 PM and 7 PM.

On **Saturday**, the average price of exchange electricity will decrease slightly, to 9.7 cents. Prices will vary from 6.2 cents to 16.1 cents. The coldest temperatures are forecast for Saturday, -7.6 degrees, which will keep the demand for electricity high. On Saturday, there is also a risk that the prices of individual hours will rise to 20-40 cents, especially in the morning between 8 AM and 10 AM.
