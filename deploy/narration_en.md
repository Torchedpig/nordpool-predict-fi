*Electricity prices will remain mostly low, even negative at times, in the coming days, but next Tuesday, prices are expected to briefly rise above 11 cents per kilowatt-hour due to weak wind power production. Otherwise, prices will remain moderate, and temperature will not significantly affect pricing.*

The Olkiluoto 1 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing a maintenance outage. During this outage, available capacity is at 0 MW, lasting from 11 May 2025 at 18:00 to 22 May 2025 at 18:00. This outage may affect the accuracy of this forecast, as historical data during nuclear maintenance periods is limited.

Electricity prices will remain mostly low, even negative, during the coming week. Average daily prices will range from Thursday's -0.9 cents to Tuesday's 3.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. During certain hours, prices will drop significantly into negative territory, especially during the early hours of **Thursday**. Electricity will be cheapest from 03:00 to 05:00 early Thursday morning, when prices will fall nearly three cents below zero.

The week's lowest average prices will occur on **Thursday** and **Saturday**, when pricing expectations are slightly negative. On Thursday, ample wind power averaging 4391 MW helps explain the very low prices. Similarly, **Saturday's** price expectations remain negative, although average wind production will be somewhat more moderate at around 2992 MW.

The highest prices are expected next **Tuesday**, when the average price will rise to 3.6 cents. On Tuesday, hourly prices will peak exceptionally high between approximately 07:00 and 09:00 in the morning, reaching above 11 cents per kilowatt-hour. This price spike is due to particularly low wind power production, dropping to a minimum of about 977 MW. Thus, Tuesday carries a high risk of individual hourly price spikes.

**Sunday** also carries some risk of higher prices during certain hours, even though the day's average price remains below one cent. Sunday will see among the week's lowest average wind power production, below 2000 MW, explaining the day's maximum price of nearly four cents per kilowatt-hour between 19:00 and 21:00.

Otherwise, daily prices during the week will remain fairly uniform, with low risk of price spikes. Average temperatures throughout the week will stay close to seven degrees Celsius, and temperature is not expected to influence electricity prices significantly.
