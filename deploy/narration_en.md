The exchange electricity price forecast shows fluctuating price levels for the coming week. On Wednesday and Thursday, the price of electricity will rise higher, but after that the price will fall significantly for the weekend and remain at a low level until next Tuesday.

On **Wednesday**, the average price of electricity will rise to 15.7 cents per kilowatt-hour, and the highest price of the day could rise up to 22.8 cents. There are also individual hours forecast for Wednesday, when prices could rise as high as 40-60 cents per kilowatt-hour. Price spikes will likely occur during the morning hours, around 8-10 am. The price on Wednesday is pushed up especially by the scarcity of wind power: only 119-794 megawatts of wind power are forecast to be available.

**Thursday** will be similar to Wednesday, albeit slightly cheaper. The average price will be 14.0 ¬¢, but the maximum price may rise to 18.6 cents. High price spikes are also expected on Thursday, up to 30-50 cents per kilowatt-hour, most likely in the morning between 7 and 9 am. The price difference between Wednesday and Thursday is likely explained by the fact that slightly more wind power will be available on Thursday than on Wednesday.

On **Friday**, the price will fall, and the average price is predicted to be 7.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. Friday's maximum price, 16.1 ¬¢, will likely fall well below the peak figures of Wednesday and Thursday, but may still rise momentarily to 20-30 cents. The risk of a price spike most likely applies to the morning hours. Wind power production on Friday will vary considerably during the day, and this is likely to be reflected in prices. At night and in the morning, there will be little wind, but in the afternoon and evening, wind power will be abundantly available, up to over 4000 megawatts.

During the weekend and the beginning of next week, the price of electricity will fall very low. On **Saturday**, the average price will be only 2.8 ¬¢ per kilowatt-hour, and on **Sunday** slightly higher, 3.4 ¬¢. On **Monday**, the average price will rise to 5.0 cents, but will fall again on Tuesday to 1.5 cents. On **Tuesday**, it is even possible that the price of electricity will momentarily turn negative. The low prices of the weekend and the beginning of next week are explained by abundant wind power: wind power is forecast to be available on average over 3700 megawatts per day.
