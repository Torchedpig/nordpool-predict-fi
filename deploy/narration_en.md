The electricity price forecast for the coming week shows varying price levels. Electricity will be most expensive on **Wednesday**, when the average price for the day is expected to be 15.2 ¬¢/kWh. Wednesday's maximum price may rise to 23.1 cents per kilowatt-hour, but during individual hours there is a risk of price spikes of up to 40-60 cents. The most likely time for high peak prices is around 7-9 am. Wednesday's price level is explained by weak wind power production, as wind power is forecast to be at its lowest at only 83 MW during the day. Also, an average temperature below -4 degrees Celsius can contribute to the price increase.

On **Thursday**, the average price of electricity will settle at 13.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. Thursday's highest price, 17.7 ¬¢/kWh, will likely occur during the morning hours of 7-9. Wind power will also be at its lowest on Thursday at only 215 MW, and during individual hours there is a risk of 30-50 cent price spikes compared to the predicted maximum price.

On **Friday**, the price of electricity will fall significantly, and the average price is expected to be 7.5 ¬¢/kWh. There is still a risk of price spikes on Friday due to low wind power (minimum 589 MW), and individual hours can cost up to 20-30 ¬¢. Friday's highest price will likely occur around nine in the morning (8-10 am). However, as the day progresses, the price will fall, and in the afternoon and evening, electricity will be quite cheap, less than 5 cents per kilowatt-hour.

On **Saturday**, the price drops very low, with an average price of only 2.0 ¬¢/kWh. On Saturday, there will be plenty of wind power, which will push the price down. In the afternoon, between 12-14, the price will even drop to negative. On Sunday, the average price will remain affordable, at 3.7 cents per kilowatt-hour.

Next **Monday**, the average price of electricity will rise slightly, to 4.9 cents per kilowatt-hour. Next **Tuesday** is expected to be the cheapest day of the week, as the average price will remain at only 1.6 cents per kilowatt-hour, and during the day there will be several hours when the price is close to zero. Tuesday's low price is explained by very abundant wind power production.
