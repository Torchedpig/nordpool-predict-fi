Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is undergoing a maintenance break from 1.3.2025 at 03:00 to 2.5.2025 at 02:00. This maintenance break may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data during outage periods is limited.

The coming week's electricity price forecasts indicate significant variation between days. Early in the week, price levels will fluctuate considerably, but prices are expected to drop significantly toward the weekend.

**Monday** will be the most expensive day of the week, with an average price reaching 12.0 cents per kilowatt hour. Prices will particularly rise during morning and evening hours. The day's peak price, around 18 ¬¢, is expected between 9:00 and 11:00. Additionally, Monday carries a high risk of price spikes that could momentarily reach 30‚Äì50 cents per kWh, either around 9:00‚Äì11:00 in the morning or 19:00‚Äì21:00 in the evening. Very low wind power production on Monday (only 236 MW at minimum) partly explains the high prices.

On **Sunday**, prices will fluctuate notably throughout the day, even reaching slightly negative prices (-0.3 ¬¢) at night. The highest price, exceeding 15 cents, will occur in the evening between 18:00 and 20:00. Sunday's very low wind power production at times also explains the timing of the highest prices. Additionally, Sunday has a risk of price spikes up to 20‚Äì30 cents during the mentioned evening hours.

On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, price variations will be more moderate but still noteworthy. Tuesday's average price will remain around 6.7 cents, with evening hours potentially seeing short-lived increases up to 20 cents. Wednesday's average price will be slightly higher (7.3 ¬¢), with peak prices just above 12 cents during the morning hours between 9:00 and 11:00. Wind power fluctuations on these days partly explain the price variations.

The week's most affordable days will be **Friday** and **Saturday**, with average prices clearly below five cents. Friday's average price will drop as low as 0.3 cents, including negative prices at night, reaching -0.7 ¬¢ at the lowest. High wind power generation explains Friday's exceptionally low price level. On Saturday, the price level also remains affordable, averaging 2.6 cents.

The following **Sunday** will see prices stabilizing notably, with an average price of 4.7 cents and no significant intra-day variations.
