Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance, which started on 1 March 2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on 27 April 2025 at 12:00. This maintenance break may affect the accuracy of the forecast as training data during maintenance periods is limited.

Electricity prices are expected to decrease significantly as the week progresses. At the beginning of the week, particularly on **Sunday** and **Monday**, electricity prices will be at their highest. Sunday's peak price will approach 20 cents between 19:00–21:00. On Monday, electricity prices could also rise significantly, with peak prices of nearly 16 cents expected in the morning between 08:00–10:00. Moreover, Monday carries a high risk of individual price spikes, during which the electricity price could temporarily rise to as much as 20–30 cents per kilowatt-hour.

From Tuesday onwards, prices will start to decline noticeably. On **Tuesday**, the average price will drop to just above four cents, although this day too has a forecasted risk of price spikes. The maximum price is expected to be around eight cents, but occasional price spikes could raise hourly prices up to 10 cents. On Wednesday, the price level will continue to fall, with the daily average price dropping to two and a half cents. Wednesday also has potential hourly price spikes reaching 10 cents.

**Thursday** is a public holiday, which is expected to result in lower electricity demand than usual. This will further reduce prices. Thursday's average price will be just over one cent, and during the early morning hours between 02:00–04:00, prices could even dip slightly negative. However, the risk of price spikes remains, and individual hours could momentarily rise to around 10 cents.

Towards the end of the week, on **Friday** and **Saturday**, electricity prices will remain very low. Friday's average price is just 0.2 cents, with hourly prices ranging between negative and one cent throughout the day. Saturday's average is below one cent, but again there remains a risk of price spikes, with individual hourly prices potentially rising to approximately 10 cents.
