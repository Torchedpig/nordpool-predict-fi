The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is undergoing a maintenance outage. The outage began on 1 March 2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on 2 May 2025 at 02:00. Due to limited training data availability during maintenance outages, forecast accuracy may be reduced.

In the coming days, electricity prices will vary significantly. The lowest-priced day will be **Sunday**, with an average price below half a cent. Additionally, negative prices will occur during nighttime hours on **Friday**, **Saturday**, and Sunday. At these times, electricity prices will even drop into negative territory, reaching as low as -2.0 ¢ around 14:00 on Sunday.

Sunday will clearly be the most stable pricing day, with even the highest price remaining below five cents. Likewise, the public holiday on **Friday** will be inexpensive, with an average price of only 1.3 cents and a moderate maximum price just above four cents.

The week's clear price peak will occur on **Tuesday**, when electricity will cost slightly more than 18 cents at its highest, in the morning between 8:00–10:00. On the same day, the average price will rise to nearly nine cents. Tuesday also has a significant risk of price spikes, potentially pushing prices to 20–40 cents during individual hours. Such spikes typically occur during morning or evening hours.

**Thursday**, **Saturday**, **Monday**, and **Wednesday** will see more moderate pricing, averaging around one to four cents. However, on these days there will still be a small risk of price spikes, potentially raising the price toward roughly ten cents during individual hours. Thursday and Saturday will have notably higher maximum prices compared to other days, partly explained by the low minimum wind power production.

The week's lowest-priced hours will typically occur at night, especially during the night leading to Friday and from Saturday into Sunday. Conversely, the highest prices will typically appear during morning and evening peak consumption hours, particularly on Tuesday.
