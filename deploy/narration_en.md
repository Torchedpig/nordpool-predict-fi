*Electricity prices for the upcoming week will vary significantly from day to day, with higher average prices and possible price spikes in the mornings early in the week, followed by notably cheaper rates later in the week, including negative prices during nighttime and afternoon hours.*

The Olkiluoto 1 nuclear power plant is undergoing a maintenance outage that began on May 11, 2025 at 18:00 and is expected to end on May 22, 2025 at 18:00. This outage may affect the accuracy of electricity price forecasts, as training data during maintenance periods is limited.

The forecast was updated on Sunday at 12:06.

The electricity price forecast for the coming week indicates clear day-to-day variations. The week begins on **Monday** with an average price of 4.3 cents, the highest average this week. Monday also expects high hourly prices, especially from 7 to 9 in the morning, when prices might rise above 13 cents. On **Wednesday**, the average price will also rise slightly, averaging around 3.3 cents. Wednesday morning (between 7 and 9) is likely to experience the week's highest hourly rates, potentially exceeding 14 cents.

These two days also carry a clear risk of individual price spikes. The price spike on Wednesday morning, in particular, may exceed forecasts significantly, as wind power production at that time is exceptionally low, around only 700 MW.

Other days of the week offer significantly cheaper electricity. For instance, on **Tuesday**, **Thursday**, and **Friday**, average prices range from about half a cent to just over one and a half cents, with overnight prices even turning negative. On **Saturday** and **Sunday**, prices will remain low as well, although Sunday still carries a risk of individual price spikes, likely in the evening hours.

The week's cheapest hours will occur overnight and in the afternoons on **Tuesday** and **Saturday**, when prices dip as low as minus one cent. Wind power will be abundant on Thursday and Friday, explaining the very low prices on these days.

Thus, electricity price fluctuations over the week will be notable. For consumers, the most significant price increases will occur during Monday and Wednesday mornings, whereas the rest of the week will offer markedly lower price levels.
