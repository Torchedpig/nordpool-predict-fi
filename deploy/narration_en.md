Electricity prices will be highest at the beginning of the week. On **Monday**, the average price will reach 6.5 cents, clearly higher than other weekdays. Prices will fluctuate strongly during the day, with the highest rates occurring in the morning between 6:00-8:00, when price exceeds 13 cents and peaks at 15.8 cents. Wind power production on Monday will be exceptionally low, at a minimum of only 154 MW, which explains the high morning prices.

On **Tuesday**, the situation will stabilize somewhat. The average price will drop to 4.5 cents, but the risk of isolated hourly price spikes remains. The highest prices are expected in the morning hours between 8:00-10:00, when the price may rise above 13 cents according to the forecast. Minimum wind power production on Tuesday morning will be below 800 MW, increasing the risk of price spikes.

From Wednesday onward, electricity prices will fall significantly. On **Wednesday**, the average price will be below one cent, and even negative prices will appear between 13:00-15:00, with the lowest price reaching -0.8 ¬¢/kWh. In practice, this means electricity producers will pay consumers for using electricity. The reason for these low prices is the abundant wind power production, averaging over 3000 MW on Wednesday.

On **Thursday** and **Friday**, prices will remain very low. Both days will see negative hourly prices, with Thursday's lowest price at -1.4 cents and Friday's at -0.6 cents. Especially on Friday, wind power production will be strong, averaging nearly 3700 MW, keeping prices very low.

On the weekend, electricity prices will remain moderate. On **Saturday**, price fluctuations will be limited, with an average price slightly above one cent. On **Sunday**, the average price returns below one cent, but there's a risk of isolated hourly price spikes occurring between 8:00-10:00 in the morning. Sunday's lowest hourly price will be -0.8 cents, while the highest price may rise above five cents.
