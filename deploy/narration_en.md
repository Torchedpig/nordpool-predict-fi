The electricity price outlook for the week shows a fairly steady trend, but **Thursday** stands out with the highest average price of 4.1 cents per kilowatt hour. Thursday’s maximum price reaches 7.7 cents between 8–10 a.m., while minimum wind power output drops to the lowest level of the week, around 1,200 megawatts during the early morning hours. This explains both the price increase and greater volatility for that day.

**Friday** and **Wednesday** also see peak hourly prices exceeding six cents, particularly during morning and midday hours, but their daily averages remain below Thursday’s. On Saturday and Tuesday, price levels fluctuate less and stay lower, with no significant high hourly prices anticipated.

**Monday** features the week’s widest price range: the lowest hourly price dips into negative territory at -0.2 cents during the night, while the evening hours rise to 5.7 cents. The forecast highlights a risk for Monday and Tuesday that, on individual hours, prices could deviate significantly from estimates and reach up to 10 cents, especially during morning and evening peaks.

The lowest prices of the week are expected on **Sunday**, which is a public holiday. Electricity demand is projected to be low, and the average price is estimated at 1.5 cents. Sunday’s lowest hourly price falls to -0.6 cents during the late morning. There is also a risk of exceptionally high price spikes on Sunday, so individual evening hours from 10 p.m. to midnight could see higher prices than forecast.

Across the week, price levels remain well below five cents throughout the entire period; no day is expensive on average. The greatest variation occurs on Thursday and Friday, when wind power remains below normal and prices temporarily rise, but during the weekend and public holiday, prices are expected to return to low levels.
