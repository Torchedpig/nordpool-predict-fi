Significant daily variation in electricity prices is expected in the coming days. The week's highest average prices will be seen on **Thursday** and **Friday**, with averages of 8.6 and 8.0 cents per kilowatt-hour, respectively. Maximum prices on both days will rise notably high: Thursday's peak is forecasted at 13.6Â¢, and Friday's at up to 15.9Â¢.

Low wind power production, dropping clearly below 1000 megawatts at its lowest, will be behind the price fluctuations on Thursday and Friday. On Thursday, wind power will dip to as low as 495 MW, and on Friday even lower, down to 252 MW. This low wind production largely explains the high maximum prices, and both days carry significant risks of price spikes. On Thursday, single-hour prices may soar to 20â€“40Â¢, most likely during the evening peak around 17:00â€“19:00. On Friday, price spikes may surpass the 20â€“30 cent level in the morning hours around 07:00â€“09:00.

Weekend electricity prices will be significantly lower. On **Saturday**, the average price will be only 1.3 cents, and the lowest price of the day will be negative: -1.3Â¢. On **Sunday**, prices will remain low, with an average of only 0.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. Sunday will also see negative prices, reaching as low as -1.3Â¢. Windy weather conditions will result in abundant wind power generation over the weekend, supporting low prices.

At the beginning of the week, prices will continue to remain moderate. **Monday's** average price of 2.4Â¢ and **Tuesday's** average of just 0.8Â¢ indicate continued inexpensive electricity. Negative hourly prices will also occur at the start of the week, particularly on Tuesday, when prices will dip to -1.8 cents in the early afternoon around 14:00â€“16:00.

Next **Wednesday**, electricity prices will rise slightly from the week's cheapest days but will remain moderate. The average price will be 3.4Â¢, and the day will also feature negative hourly prices, reaching as low as -0.9Â¢.
