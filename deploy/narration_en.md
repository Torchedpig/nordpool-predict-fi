The price expectations for exchange electricity will vary significantly during the coming week. On Wednesday and Thursday, prices are expected to be clearly higher, while towards the end of the week and the beginning of next week, prices are expected to fall considerably.

**Wednesday** will start with reasonably affordable prices, but the price will rise towards the morning, and at its highest, it is expected to be 17.3 ¢/kWh. The average price for Wednesday is forecast to be 11.2 ¢, and during the day there is a high risk of price spikes of up to 30-40 cents in individual hours. The most likely time for a price spike is in the morning between 7 and 9 am. Wednesday's price level is partly explained by the low average temperature, even below -9 degrees Celsius. Wind power production will also remain low on Wednesday, which will contribute to higher prices.

On **Thursday**, the price of electricity is expected to remain high, and the average price is forecast to be 9.6 ¢/kWh. The price range is wide, from a low of 2.4 ¢ to a high of 15.2 ¢ per kilowatt-hour. There is also a high risk of price spikes on Thursday, with prices for individual hours potentially rising to 20-40 cents. High peak prices are most likely to be seen in the morning between 7 and 9 am. Similar to Wednesday, Thursday's price is explained by the low average temperature and low wind power production.

From **Friday** onwards, the price of electricity is expected to fall significantly. The average price for Friday is forecast to be only 3.5 ¢/kWh, and the price will vary between 1.4 and 6.4 cents. Wind power production is expected to increase on Friday, which will lower the price.

During the weekend, on **Saturday** and **Sunday**, the price of electricity is expected to remain affordable. The average price for Saturday is forecast to be 2.3 ¢ and for Sunday 2.7 ¢. Next **Monday**, the price will fall further, and the average price is expected to be only 0.7 ¢/kWh. On Monday, it is even possible that the price of electricity will temporarily fall into negative territory during the early morning hours.

Next **Tuesday**, the price of electricity will rise again, and the average price for the day is expected to be 9.7 ¢/kWh. On Tuesday, the price range is wide, from a low of 2.2 ¢ to a high of 18.4 ¢. A high risk of price spikes is also forecast for Tuesday, up to 20-40 cents for individual hours.
