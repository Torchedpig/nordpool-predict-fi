*Electricity price forecasts indicate a fluctuating week, with the cheapest rates expected on Saturday, but on Tuesday and Wednesday, the risk of price spikes may significantly raise consumer prices as wind power production decreases.*

The upcoming week's electricity market price trends appear varied. **Saturday** is expected to be the cheapest day of the week, with an average price around four cents. Ample wind power availability partly explains this low price level. On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, higher average prices are forecasted, reaching up to 10 cents per kilowatt-hour. Particularly on **Tuesday**, there is a forecasted high risk of price spikes, where individual hourly prices could rise to 20-40 cents.

On **Friday** and **Wednesday**, price spikes may occur, potentially raising individual hourly prices up to 20 cents. On these days, wind power production is forecasted to be lower, which may contribute to price increases. Temperatures remain below zero throughout the week but are not expected to play a significant role in price developments.

The week's price trends are thus diverse, with Tuesday's potential price spikes making it noteworthy. On such days, the market may experience significant fluctuations, so consumers should be aware of possible price increases. üå¨Ô∏è
