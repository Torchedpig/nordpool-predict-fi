*At the beginning of the week, electricity prices will rise significantly due to weak wind power production, with price spikes potentially reaching as high as 50 cents, but prices will decrease notably toward the end of the week, even dipping below zero at times.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance, which started on 01.03.2025 at 03:00 and is expected to last until 02.05.2025 at 02:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data during such outages is limited.

The following forecast was updated on Saturday at 09:00.

The electricity price forecast for the upcoming week shows clear variations from day to day. Prices will be higher at the beginning of the week and significantly lower toward the end.

The week's highest expected average price is on **Monday**, averaging 12,0 cents per kilowatt-hour. Monday's price range is between 4,4 and 19,1 cents, with the highest prices expected in the morning between 9-11 AM. During this period, prices might temporarily surge to levels of 30-50 ¬¢/kWh. Monday's elevated prices are partially explained by weak wind power production, fluctuating only between 363 and 1204 MW throughout the day.

Already on **Sunday**, prices will vary significantly (from -0,0 to 15,8 ¬¢), and in the evening between 7-9 PM, prices risk rising to 20-30 cents. Sunday's wind power production will at times drop very low, down to just 255 MW, contributing to the high maximum price risk in the evening hours.

From Tuesday onwards, prices will decrease considerably. On **Tuesday**, the average price is projected at 6,4 cents, with the highest prices occurring in the morning between 7-9 AM (around 11-13 ¬¢). There remains a risk of price spikes on Tuesday morning, when a single hour's price might rise up to 20 cents.

The most expensive days will be at the beginning of the week, but from Wednesday onwards prices will remain moderate. On **Friday**, the week's lowest average price will be only 0,3 cents, with prices dipping into negative territory during nighttime. Abundant wind power production (5350 - 5868 MW) explains Friday's exceptionally low prices. Prices will also be affordable on **Thursday** and **Saturday**, occasionally turning negative on Thursday.

Next **Sunday**, prices will stabilize around five cents, with no significant fluctuations expected throughout the day.
