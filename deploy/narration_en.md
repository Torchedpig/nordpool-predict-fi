The coming week looks quite variable in terms of prices. Electricity price expectations will fall to their lowest next **Monday**, when the average daily price will remain at only 0.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. Monday's cheapest hours will be in the early morning and late morning, when the price may temporarily drop to zero.

Next **Tuesday**, the average price of exchange electricity will rise to 4.7 cents. Tuesday is the only day when there is no risk of price spikes at all, so the day's predicted maximum price of 9.4 ¢ will remain in effect. After Tuesday, the price of electricity will rise to a significantly higher level.

The most expensive day seems to be next **Saturday**, when the average price will rise to 10.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. Saturday's highest price, 17.7 ¢, will be in the evening between 6 PM and 8 PM. However, a price spike is forecast for Saturday, and prices for individual hours could rise as high as 30-40 cents.

Next **Wednesday**, **Friday**, and **Sunday** also have a high risk of price spikes. On Wednesday and Friday, prices for individual hours could rise as high as 30-40 cents, while on Sunday the corresponding figure is 20-30 cents. The possible time for price spikes is typically in the morning around 7-9 AM or in the evening around 5-7 PM. Even on **Thursday**, there's a risk of a price spike, where prices could rise up to 20 cents during individual hours.

Wind power production will be mostly at a low level during the coming week, which partly explains the higher prices. Especially on Thursday and Saturday, wind power is forecast to be very low, averaging less than 1300 megawatts. At its lowest, wind power production will fall below one thousand megawatts on Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday.

The average temperatures for the week will remain around zero or slightly below freezing, which may increase electricity consumption and thus have a partial effect on the price level.
