The price expectations for electricity on the Nord Pool spot market show large variations for the coming week. On **Tuesday**, the average price of electricity is expected to be around 2.9 cents per kilowatt-hour. Tuesday is a fairly typical day in terms of price, and the price will remain affordable throughout the day. During the cheapest hours of the night, the price is expected to fall below half a cent.

**Wednesday** and **Thursday** look to be significantly more expensive days. The average price on Wednesday is expected to rise to 11.2 cents, and on Thursday the average price is expected to be 10.0 cents per kilowatt-hour. On both days, the price of electricity will rise to a maximum of 17.7 cents. There is also a high risk of price spikes on Wednesday and Thursday. Prices for individual hours can rise up to 30-40 cents per kilowatt-hour.

The risk of price spikes is highest on Wednesday evening, around 5-7 PM. On Thursday, the risk of price spikes is greatest in the morning, around 7-9 AM. The high prices are due to low wind power production. Between Wednesday and Thursday, wind power is forecast to be at its lowest, at only around 1000 megawatts. The hard frost on Wednesday and Thursday, with an average temperature of -9.3 degrees Celsius, can also partly explain the high prices.

On **Friday**, the average price of electricity on the Nord Pool spot market returns to a very affordable level, around 2.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. The price fluctuation on Friday will remain small, with the price of the most expensive hour being 5.6 cents. On Friday, there will be plenty of wind power available, which will lower the price of electricity.

Next weekend (**Saturday** and **Sunday**), the price of electricity will remain affordable, with average prices of 3.4 and 2.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. Next **Monday**, the price will be the cheapest of the week, with the average price falling to 0.7 cents. On Monday night, the price will even fall into negative territory.
