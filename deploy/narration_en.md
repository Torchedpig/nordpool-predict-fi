The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The outage began on 1.3.2025 at 03:00, with an expected end date on 29.4.2025 at 01:00. The maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data for similar situations is limited.

The average electricity price is expected to fluctuate significantly during the week. In particular, **Wednesday** stands out clearly due to its higher average price of 6.1 cents. Prices on Wednesday morning between 07:00 and 09:00 may rise as high as 11.5 cents. Additionally, the risk of price spikes on Wednesday is higher than usual; on certain hours, prices may even reach up to 20 cents per kilowatt-hour. This price increase is partly explained by Wednesday's exceptionally low wind power production, averaging only 631 megawatts.

On other days, the average prices remain low. **Tuesday's** average price of 2.8 cents is not particularly high, and no price spikes are expected. **Thursday** is a public holiday, which lowers electricity demand and accordingly reduces prices. Thursday's average price is only 1.5 cents, and negative prices are also expected during the day. Lowest prices on Thursday will reach -0.6 cents.

The latter part of the week remains inexpensive as well. **Friday** will have an average price of only about one cent, with moderate price fluctuations. **Saturday** will see the week's lowest average price, even dipping into negative territory (-0.4 ¬¢). At its lowest, electricity price on Saturday will be -1.2 cents during early morning hours between 02:00 and 04:00. This low price level stems from high wind power production on the weekend, which on Saturday and **Sunday** will occasionally exceed 4700 megawatts.

On **Monday**, electricity prices will rise slightly compared to the weekend but will still remain low, with an average price of 3.1 cents. Even though daily fluctuations are somewhat greater than during the weekend, Monday does not bring any risk of price spikes.

All in all, electricity prices in the next few days will remain relatively affordable, with the notable exception of Wednesday, when weak wind power production will significantly raise price levels, along with the risk of isolated price spikes during morning hours.
