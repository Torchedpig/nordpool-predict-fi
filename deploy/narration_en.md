Exchange electricity price expectations will vary in the coming days. On **Saturday**, the price will rise high, and the average price for the day is expected to be as high as 10.0 ¢/kWh. The maximum price on Saturday could rise up to 19.7 cents per kilowatt-hour.

After Saturday, the price of electricity will settle at a clearly more affordable level. The average price on Sunday will remain at 3.8 cents, and at its cheapest, electricity will be available for only 0.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. On **Sunday**, there will be a very large supply of wind power, which will push prices down.

Next week, the price of electricity will mostly remain affordable. On **Monday**, the average price will be 2.2 ¢, and the price of electricity may even dip to -0.9 ¢ for some hours. Also on **Tuesday**, the price will momentarily fall below zero, and the average price for the day will remain at 1.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. There will be plenty of wind power available throughout the week.

The average price on **Wednesday** and **Friday** will rise to 4.5 cents, but will still remain at a normal level. On Friday, the price of electricity will rise to ten cents in the evening, but unlike Saturday, the rise will be short-lived. On **Thursday**, the price will remain at an average of three cents per kilowatt-hour.

The only clearly more expensive day of the week is therefore Saturday. On Saturday, there will be less wind power available than normal, which partly explains the price increase. In addition, the temperature will fall below freezing during the night and early morning hours, which will increase electricity consumption.
