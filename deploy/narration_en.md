The coming week looks twofold in terms of the price of exchange electricity. The beginning of the week until **Tuesday** is inexpensive, but prices will rise towards the end of the week.

On **Sunday**, the average price of exchange electricity will remain very low, only 0.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. The price will fall below zero during the early morning hours. On Sunday, wind power will be very abundant, which explains the low price level.

On Tuesday, the average price of exchange electricity will rise slightly, but will still be inexpensive, 3.3 ¢/kWh. On Tuesday night, the price will momentarily go below zero.

On Wednesday and onwards, prices will rise significantly. The average price for **Wednesday** is predicted to be 6.9 ¢/kWh, and the price will vary from 1.6 cents to 11.4 cents. Wind power production will decrease from the beginning of the week, which partly explains the rise in prices.

On **Thursday**, the average price will settle at 6.2 cents per kilowatt-hour, and price expectations will vary from 1.2 cents to 12.3 cents.

**Friday** is predicted to have the highest average price of the week, 7.5 ¢/kWh. Price expectations vary from 3.4 cents to 12.6 cents. There is also a risk of price spikes on Friday, when the prices of individual hours can rise up to 20 cents. The most likely time for a price spike is in the morning around 7-9 AM. Wind power production will remain at a low level.

Next **Saturday**, the average price of exchange electricity will be 6.9 ¢/kWh. On Saturday, the minimum production of wind power will remain very low, only slightly above one thousand megawatts. A very high risk of price spikes is predicted for Saturday. The prices of individual hours can rise up to 20-30 cents per kilowatt-hour. The price spike is most likely to occur in the early evening, around 6-8 PM.
