The electricity price trend will vary significantly in the coming days. Considerable differences will occur between days. The largest price variations will take place during the weekend and early in the week. Average prices will range from an affordable level around two cents up to nearly eight cents per kilowatt-hour.

On **Saturday**, electricity prices will mostly remain affordable, with even negative prices seen during nighttime and afternoon hours. Prices will reach their lowest point below zero overnight between 01:00 and 03:00. However, in the evening between 19:00 and 21:00, the price will rise above six cents, peaking around 20:00 when electricity will cost above nine cents.

Clearly, the week's most expensive day will be **Sunday**. The average price will climb to eight cents, and the highest prices will occur in the morning between roughly 08:00 and 10:00, when electricity could cost over 12 cents. Additionally, Sunday carries a significant risk of price spikes during individual hours, potentially reaching as high as 20‚Äì30 cents.

**Monday** will also have high price levels, averaging nearly eight cents. Monday carries an elevated risk of price spikes especially during the morning from 08:00 to 10:00, with potential prices reaching 20‚Äì30 cents. The rise in prices will be partly explained by weak wind power production in the morning, with output just slightly above 1000 MW.

The week's most affordable days will be **Wednesday** and **Friday**, with average prices staying below one cent. On Wednesday, electricity pricing may even turn negative during early morning hours between 03:00 and 05:00. This extremely affordable pricing is due to abundant wind power production, exceeding 5000 MW for most of the day.

On **Tuesday** and **Thursday**, prices will remain moderate, averaging around three to four cents. On Tuesday, prices will briefly dip into negative territory in the afternoon between 16:00 and 18:00. These days will be supported by good wind power production, reflected in moderate prices.
