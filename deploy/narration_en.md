Electricity price expectations for the coming days will vary significantly. The most expensive day of the week will be **Wednesday**, with an expected average electricity price of around 7.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. High prices are also forecasted for individual hours; in the evening between 18:00 and 20:00, electricity prices could rise as high as 13.7 cents. The forecast indicates a high risk of price spikes on Wednesday, during which prices could temporarily surge to 20–30 cents per kWh for individual hours.

Wednesday's exceptionally high maximum price clearly relates to the forecasted lower wind power production. Wind power generation will drop to as low as 1193 megawatts. This low wind power minimum production explains the higher expected prices on Wednesday.

The cheapest days of the week will be **Sunday** and **Tuesday**, when average electricity prices will remain clearly below one cent. Negative hourly prices are also expected on both days. Early Sunday night from 00:00 to 01:00, prices could even reach -0.6 cents. On Tuesday night between 02:00 and 03:00, the electricity price is predicted to drop as low as -1.6 cents.

Prices will also remain moderate on **Thursday**, **Friday**, and **Saturday**. The average prices for these days will all be below three cents. Price fluctuations will also remain relatively small, and no significant price increases are expected.

The weekly price peak will thus clearly occur during Wednesday evening hours. On other days, electricity prices will remain moderate or even very affordable. Consumers should pay particular attention to price developments on Wednesday due to the heightened risk of price spikes.
