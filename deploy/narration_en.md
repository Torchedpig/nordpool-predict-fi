The electricity price forecast for the coming week shows varying figures. Weekend prices are mostly moderate, but next week the price of electricity will rise significantly. **Monday** and **Tuesday**, in particular, stand out as more expensive days. The average price for Monday is forecast to be 10.6 ¢/kWh, and the maximum price could rise as high as 16.9 cents per kilowatt-hour. Tuesday's average price is very close to Monday's figure, 10.3 ¢/kWh, and the maximum price could be as high as 17.0 ¢.

There is also a high risk of price spikes on Monday and Tuesday. During individual hours, prices could rise as high as 30-40 cents per kilowatt-hour. Price spikes will likely occur during the morning and evening hours. Monday's price spike may occur between 7-9 am, and a similar spike on Tuesday could occur around 7-9 am.

On **Wednesday**, price expectations are slightly lower, but even then there is a risk of individual price spikes, up to 20 cents. Wednesday's highest prices will likely be in the morning hours, around 7-9 am. After Wednesday, starting next Thursday, significantly lower prices can be expected, provided that wind power is available as forecast.

On **Thursday**, the price of electricity will fall very low, with the average price for the day expected to be only 1.5 ¢/kWh. During Thursday, the price of electricity will be at its lowest only 0.1 ¢/kWh, and at its highest only 6.1 ¢. On **Friday**, the price will rise somewhat, but will still remain reasonable, with an average price of 6.0 ¢. On Friday, however, it is worth preparing for the risk of price spikes, when the prices of individual hours can rise up to 20 cents.

During the weekend, the price of electricity will vary. **Saturday** will be inexpensive, with an average price of 2.3 ¢. On Sunday, the price will rise again, and the average price is expected to be 5.7 ¢ per kilowatt-hour. Sunday's highest price, 12.2 ¢, will be in the evening, around 5-7 pm.
