The electricity price forecast for the coming days predicts significant variation. The highest prices of the week are anticipated on **Monday**, when the average electricity price will be 11.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. Throughout the day, prices will range between 6.3 and 20.2 cents, with individual hours potentially reaching price spikes of as high as 30â€“50 cents. The risk of price spikes is particularly high during morning hours between 7:00â€“9:00 and later in the morning around 9:00â€“11:00.

On **Wednesday**, electricity price fluctuations will also be exceptionally large. Prices will vary from zero up to over 42 cents. The highest price occurs in the morning between 8:00â€“10:00, exceeding 42 cents. This spike is partially explained by exceptionally low minimum wind power production (318 MW) during the morning hours, significantly raising prices at that time.

Conversely, from midweek (**Thursday**) through **Saturday**, electricity prices will remain extremely low. Particularly on **Saturday**, the average price will remain under one cent, with prices even becoming negative at certain times. Similarly, on **Thursday**, prices will briefly dip negative, reaching as low as -0.5 cents. This is due to strong wind power generation, which remains high and significantly lowers prices during these days.

On **Sunday**, electricity prices will rise again. The average price will increase to 7.1 cents, with the day's highest price forecasted at 17.9 cents. However, the risk of price spikes remains high, and prices during individual hours may climb as high as 20â€“30 cents, particularly on Sunday evening between 19:00â€“21:00.

Prices will also stay elevated on **Tuesday**, averaging 9.6 cents and peaking at nearly 16 cents. There is also a notable risk of price spikes on Tuesday, when hourly prices may briefly soar to 20â€“40 cents, especially in the morning around 8:00â€“10:00.
