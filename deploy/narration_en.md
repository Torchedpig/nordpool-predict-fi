Electricity prices for the upcoming week are expected to remain mostly affordable. Daily average prices will stay clearly below five cents. Starting from the weekend, prices will occasionally even dip into negative territory.

The cheapest days of the week will be **Friday**, **Saturday**, and **Sunday**, with average prices hovering around zero cents. On Friday, the lowest hourly rate occurs late at night between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m., dipping down to -1.7 cents. Negative hourly rates, around minus one cent, will also occur overnight on Saturday and Sunday.

Price levels will rise slightly at the beginning of the week. On **Monday**, the daily average price will climb to 3.6 cents, and the first higher hourly prices of the week will occur. On Monday morning, between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the price will peak at 7.4 cents. On **Tuesday**, the average price will drop again to 1.4 cents, although prices throughout the day will remain positive.

**Wednesday** and **Thursday** prices will be slightly higher than earlier in the week. On Wednesday, prices will fluctuate considerably, and the day's highest hourly price of 7.4 cents will occur in the evening between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. On Thursday, the average price will settle at the week's highest level, 4.4 cents, and the highest single hourly price of the week, 7.8 cents, will be recorded.

Wind power production on Thursday will be clearly the lowest of the week, ranging between 1292 and 2000 megawatts. This low level of wind generation partly explains the higher price level on Thursday. Additionally, there is a risk of even higher price spikes on Thursday, potentially reaching up to 10 cents per kilowatt-hour during individual hours.

Overall, the coming days will offer mostly affordable electricity, although Thursday will see the week's highest prices.
