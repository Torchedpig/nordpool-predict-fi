In the coming week, market electricity prices are expected to remain moderate, with only minor day-to-day fluctuations. The highest average price of the week is forecast for Thursday, when the daily average rises to 4.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Friday, the price is also expected to stay just above four cents on average. On these days, wind power production remains at relatively low levels throughout the day, which explains the higher price expectations.

Monday will see the week’s highest single hourly price, as prices are forecast to surge to 10.8 cents between 8 and 10 pm. This is due to a clear drop in wind power production towards the evening, pushing up electricity prices during these hours. On other days, maximum prices remain much lower, but for Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, there is a noted risk of temporary price spikes, with rates potentially reaching 10 cents during individual hours. According to the forecast, these possible spikes most often occur during the morning (7–9 am) or evening (6–8 pm) hours.

The lowest prices of the week are expected for Sunday, which is a public holiday. Demand for electricity is typically lower on such days, and the average price is projected to stay at 1.5 cents. The lowest hourly price on Sunday will even dip into negative values between 4 and 6 pm, when electricity generation momentarily exceeds consumption. Saturday is also among the most affordable days of the week, with the average price remaining below three cents.

Wind power production will stay somewhat below typical levels throughout the week, especially on Thursday and Friday, when daily variation is also minimal. This is reflected in higher average prices on those days. On Monday, wind production varies widely and influences the hourly price swings.

Overall, the week is expected to be rather steady for electricity users, with no single exceptionally expensive days anticipated. Price differences are mainly tied to fluctuations in wind power production and possible temporary spikes during individual hours.
