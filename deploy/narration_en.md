The week’s electricity price forecasts appear moderate, with no single day exceeding an average price of five cents. **Friday** is expected to see the week's highest average price at 4.9¢, and also the highest maximum price, as prices may briefly rise to 8.3¢ during the morning and forenoon. On this day, wind power generation remains low, especially in the morning, which explains the higher price.

**Thursday** will see a slightly elevated average price and noticeable intra-day variation. Wind power production stays exceptionally low throughout the day, with the minimum dropping to as little as 517 megawatts. This low wind generation explains the higher maximum price, which is expected during the morning hours between 8 and 10, when the price could momentarily reach 7.9¢. The forecast also mentions the possibility of isolated price spikes on individual hours, potentially up to 10¢.

The cheapest day of the week will be **Sunday**, when demand is lower due to the public holiday and the average price drops to 1.5¢. The minimum price even turns negative, reaching as low as -0.8¢ during the early afternoon hours between 13 and 15. Wind power generation on Sunday varies through the day but stays, on average, somewhat higher than on Thursday and Friday. The risk of price spikes is noted as possible, but overall prices are forecast to remain low.

The beginning of the week is rather stable, and on **Wednesday** and **Saturday**, electricity prices are expected to remain moderate, averaging around 3 cents. On Monday and Tuesday, the price level rises slightly but still remains well below five cents. On Tuesday, the highest price of the day may occur in the morning between 8 and 10, briefly reaching up to 8¢. Both days also carry a noted risk of isolated hours with higher prices than forecast.

Of the nuclear plants, Loviisa 2 is currently undergoing maintenance. The plant's output is 3 megawatts and its capacity utilization rate is 1.2 percent. The maintenance outage began on 4 May 2025 at 17:00 and is expected to end on 6 May 2025 at 20:00. The maintenance period may affect forecast accuracy, as there is limited training data available for such outages.

Overall, electricity prices will generally remain moderate throughout the coming week, but Thursday and Friday mornings as well as Tuesday morning may see occasional higher prices, especially when wind power is at its lowest. On Sunday, negative prices may even occur.
