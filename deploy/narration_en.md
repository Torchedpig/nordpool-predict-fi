During the upcoming week, electricity prices will vary clearly depending on the day. The beginning of the week will be noticeably more expensive, and on **Monday**, prices will peak as high as 16.7 cents. Monday also carries a high risk for hourly price spikes, potentially rising as high as 20‚Äì40 cents. The highest prices will occur on Monday morning between 8 and 10. Low wind power production during the morning partly explains these elevated prices.

**Sunday's** average price will be 6.7 cents, with hourly peaks at 11.2 cents. Sunday also carries a risk for price spikes, potentially reaching around 20 cents for individual hours.

On **Tuesday**, prices will already decrease significantly. Although the day's maximum price will be 13 cents during the morning, in the latter half of the day prices will clearly fall lower. In the evening and at night, prices may even drop below five cents. Tuesday, however, still holds a risk for single-hour price spikes, which could rise around 20 cents.

Midweek and the latter half of the week will clearly be more affordable. On **Wednesday**, prices will remain exceptionally low, with an average price of only 0.7 cents. Wednesday will also see the first negative prices, dropping as low as -0.8 cents during the night and early morning.

Negative prices will continue later in the week, and on **Thursday** and **Friday**, average prices will remain below two cents. **Saturday** will be exceptional, with the day's average price even turning negative at -0.2 cents. Prices on Saturday will reach their lowest at -2.3 cents during the afternoon between 13:00 and 15:00.

Looking at the price trend, the beginning of the week clearly stands out as a more expensive period compared to the latter half. Wind power production significantly influences price fluctuations, and especially in the latter half of the week, abundant wind power will drive down electricity prices.
