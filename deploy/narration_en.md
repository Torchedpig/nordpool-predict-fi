Electricity prices in the upcoming week will display clear fluctuations. Price expectations from Thursday to Saturday remain relatively affordable, but from Sunday onward, prices will begin to rise.

On **Thursday** and **Friday**, prices will remain low, with average prices slightly above one cent. Both days will experience some negative hourly pricesâ€”for example, on Thursday, the cheapest hours will be in the afternoon between 15:00 and 17:00, when prices will dip almost one cent negative. Friday's price level will similarly range from negative -0.4 Â¢ up to 2.9 Â¢, staying primarily at a very low level throughout the day.

**Saturday's** average price will also remain affordable at 3.2 cents. During early morning hours on Saturday, electricity will again briefly be available at negative prices (-0.5 Â¢). The highest prices of the day are expected in the afternoon between 13:00 and 15:00, potentially rising close to eight cents.

The situation will change on **Sunday**, when the average electricity price rises to 6.5 cents. Prices expected during the day will range between 3.9 and 11.0 Â¢, and the risk of individual hourly price spikes will increase significantly. Sunday's most expensive hours will occur in the evening between 18:00 and 20:00, when prices may momentarily rise up to 20 cents per kilowatt-hour.

The clearly most expensive day of the week will be **Monday**, with an average electricity price climbing to 9.7 cents. The highest predicted hourly price on Monday is 15.8 cents, but individual hourly price spikes may be considerably higher, up to 20â€“40 Â¢. Monday's price peak is expected to occur in the morning hours between 8:00 and 10:00.

On **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, price levels will moderate once again. Tuesday's expected average price is 5.9 cents and Wednesday's 3.2 cents. Prices will fluctuate moderately on both days, and Wednesday will again see occasional negative hourly prices at night and in the early morning hours.
