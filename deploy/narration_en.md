Electricity prices will vary considerably between days in the coming week. The cheapest days of the week will occur on public holidays, when electricity demand is lower than on regular weekdays. On **Sunday**, the average electricity price will be particularly low, just 0.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. The week's lowest individual price will also be seen on the same day, dipping as low as negative two cents between 10:00 and 12:00 in the morning.

On **Friday** and **Saturday**, electricity will also be relatively inexpensive, averaging around three cents. Both days will experience negative prices during nighttime: on Friday, the lowest price (-0.8 ¬¢) will occur in the early morning hours between 4:00 and 6:00, and on Saturday negative prices will be reached in the afternoon between 14:00 and 16:00. Even though prices will generally be low, both days carry a slight risk of individual price spikes up to about 10 cents.

The week's highest price will be on **Thursday**, when the daily average price will rise close to ten cents. Thursday's most expensive hours will occur in the evening between 19:00 and 21:00, when the price will exceed 20 cents. Thursday's extremely low minimum wind power production (760 MW) partly explains this peak price.

Prices will also rise significantly next **Tuesday**, when the average price reaches ten cents. There will be a high risk of price spikes on Tuesday; individual hourly prices could soar to between 20 and 40 cents. This spike is again explained by very low average wind power production (1003 MW) and an exceptionally low minimum production (634 MW). Likely price spikes are expected in the morning between 8:00 and 10:00.

An ongoing nuclear power plant maintenance outage may influence the accuracy of forecasts, as prediction models have limited data available for similar situations. Maintenance is currently taking place at Olkiluoto 3, which started on 1 March 2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end around 2 May 2025 at 02:00.
