The price of exchange electricity will remain mostly affordable during the coming week. During the weekend and early next week, the average price of electricity will remain below two cents per kilowatt-hour. **Friday** and **Saturday** will even see negative prices. On Saturday, the average price of electricity will fall to -0.1 cents.

The price level will start to rise on **Tuesday**, when the average price will increase to 2.7 cents. On Wednesday and Thursday, the average prices will already be significantly higher. Electricity will be most expensive next Thursday, when the average price for the day is forecast to be 7.4 ¢.

The maximum price next Thursday will rise to 12.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. The minimum production of wind power will remain low on the same day, at only 1691 megawatts, which partly explains the higher price. For individual hours, there is a risk that the price will rise significantly higher than forecast. The price peak is likely to occur in the evening, around 6-8 PM.

On other days, the fluctuations in the price of electricity will remain smaller.

The night between Wednesday and Thursday will be an affordable time, as the price will fall below four cents.
