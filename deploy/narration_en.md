The price of electricity on the exchange will vary considerably this week. The cheapest days will be **Saturday** and **Sunday**, when the average prices will remain around 4 ¢/kWh. The most expensive day will be **Wednesday**, when the average price rises to 15.5 cents per kilowatt-hour.

On Wednesday, the price of electricity will rise sharply, and intra-day variation will be significant. Wednesday's highest price, 20.5 ¢/kWh, is likely to be in the evening between 6 and 8 pm. Prices for individual hours could rise as high as 40-60 cents, as there is a high risk of price spikes on Wednesday. The risk of price spikes on Wednesday is explained by the low wind power production, as wind power is forecast to be available only 91-876 MW. There is also a high risk of price spikes on **Tuesday**: prices for individual hours could rise as high as 30-40 cents. At that time, wind power production will be at its lowest at 844 MW.

**Thursday** is expected to see high prices, but not as high as Wednesday. Thursday's maximum price, 18.6 ¢/kWh, will be in the morning, around 7-9 am. Prices for individual hours could rise up to 30-50 cents, as there is also a high risk of price spikes on Thursday. Wind power will be scarce on Thursday, at a minimum of only 790 MW.

On **Friday**, wind power production will increase, and the price will decrease. There is still a risk of price spikes on Friday, but significantly lower than the previous days, at most around 20 ¢/kWh for individual hours.

Over the weekend and next **Monday**, the price of electricity will settle at a lower level. Saturday and Sunday will see the cheapest hours of the week, with prices falling below two cents. On Sunday night, the price may temporarily dip below zero.
