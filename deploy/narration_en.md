The price of electricity on the power exchange will vary considerably over the next few days. On **Thursday**, the price will rise very high, and the average price for the day is expected to be 15.6 Â¢/kWh. Thursday's highest price, 21.7 Â¢, is likely to be during the morning hours of 8-10. Very little wind power is expected during the day, only 110-772 MW, which partly explains the high price level. In addition, there is a high risk of price spikes, with prices for individual hours potentially rising to 40-60 cents per kilowatt-hour.

On **Friday**, price expectations are lower, but still higher than on other days. The average price is forecast to be 9.0 Â¢/kWh. There is also a high risk of price spikes on Friday, and prices for individual hours could rise to 20-40 cents.

From **Saturday** onwards, the price of electricity is expected to fall significantly. The average prices for Saturday and Sunday will be below 3 Â¢/kWh, and a very low average price of 1.2 Â¢ is also forecast for Monday. On Saturday and Sunday, the price of electricity is even likely to fall into negative territory for a few hours during the night and afternoon.

Next **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, the price will remain low, with average prices of 2.3 Â¢ and 3.4 Â¢. On Wednesday, the price will rise momentarily close to 9 Â¢ in the morning, but will then fall rapidly.

The low prices at the weekend and early next week are largely explained by abundant wind power. From Saturday to Tuesday, wind power production is expected to remain high, averaging 3500-5000 MW.
