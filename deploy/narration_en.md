The coming week looks quite variable in terms of the price of exchange electricity. On **Friday**, the price of electricity will rise significantly higher than on other days. The average price on Friday will be as high as 20.2 ¬¢/kWh, and during the day the price will vary from 10.0 cents to as much as 36.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. Friday's price may be partly explained by the fact that wind power is forecast to be available only in small amounts, on average 762 MW.

On **Saturday**, price expectations are already significantly lower, as the average price for the day is forecast to be 7.3 ¬¢. The maximum price on Saturday will remain at 11.1 cents. On Saturday, wind power is expected to be available in much larger quantities than on Friday, with an average of 2835 MW. However, it should be noted that there is a risk of price spikes of up to 20 cents during individual hours on Saturday.

On **Sunday**, the price of exchange electricity will fall further, and the average price for the day is expected to be 6.1 ¬¢. During Sunday, the price will fluctuate between 2.7 and 9.9 cents. Sunday's low price level is explained by the very abundant wind power production, which is forecast to be available on average up to 3538 MW.

Next **Monday**, the price will rise again, and the average price for the day is expected to be 11.5 ¬¢. Monday's daily variation is large, with the price ranging between 4.4 and 19.0 cents. A high risk of price spikes of up to 30-50 cents for individual hours is also forecast for Monday. The price spike is likely to occur in the evening, between approximately 5 PM and 7 PM.

Next **Tuesday** and **Wednesday**, the price of exchange electricity is expected to settle around 9 cents. On Wednesday, however, there is a risk that the prices of individual hours could rise up to 20 cents. Next **Thursday**, the average price of exchange electricity will be 9.5 ¬¢, and there is also a risk of price spikes of around 20 cents on Thursday.

For the whole week, it can be said that the price of exchange electricity will vary considerably. The most expensive hours will be on Friday, when the price can rise up to 36.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. The cheapest electricity will be available on Sunday, when the price can fall to less than three cents.
