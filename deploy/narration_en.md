*Electricity exchange prices will rise significantly in early week due to low wind power generation, but strong winds from mid-week onwards will push prices down to zero and even negative. Prices will rise again on Sunday.*

The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is undergoing maintenance, which began on March 1, 2025, at 03:00 and is expected to end on May 2, 2025, at 02:00. The maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as training data available during outages is limited.

The electricity exchange prices will show clear fluctuations early in the week. The week's highest prices will occur on **Monday** and **Tuesday**, when electricity prices will occasionally exceed 15 cents. On **Monday**, the price may rise up to nearly 18 cents between 10:00 and 12:00. In addition, individual price spikes not yet shown in the forecast table may raise prices up to 30‚Äì50 cents, especially during the morning hours. The high prices are due to extremely weak wind power production, which will drop as low as 205 megawatts on Monday.

On **Tuesday**, prices remain relatively high, with an average price slightly above 10 cents. There is still a risk of price spikes, and prices could momentarily rise as high as 30 cents during morning and early evening hours, when electricity consumption is typically at its peak.

In the middle of the week, the situation will change significantly. From **Wednesday** onwards, wind power generation will increase notably, bringing electricity prices down to moderate levels. On **Thursday**, electricity prices will reach zero levels early in the morning. On **Friday** and **Saturday**, even negative prices will occur, as abundant wind power generation coincides with low demand.

On **Saturday**, the lowest price will be as low as -1.9 cents per kilowatt-hour during the afternoon between 14:00 and 16:00. This means electricity producers will pay to supply electricity to maintain the balance between production and consumption. Prices will remain low throughout the weekend.

On **Sunday**, however, prices will rise again as average wind power production drops below 2500 megawatts. Sunday's highest price will rise above 11 cents in the evening, between 18:00 and 20:00. Additionally, Sunday will still carry a risk of individual price spikes, potentially raising prices temporarily up to 20 cents.
