Electricity prices for the upcoming week will vary considerably from day to day. **Tuesday** clearly stands out from the rest of the week with notably higher prices: the day's average price is expected to be around 5.8 cents, and the maximum price will exceed 15 cents per kilowatt-hour. Electricity will be most expensive on Tuesday morning between approximately 8‚Äì10 AM, with hourly prices potentially reaching 15.1 cents according to the hourly forecast. The risk of price spikes during individual hours will be high, especially in the morning, largely due to exceptionally low wind power generation. Wind power minimum generation on Tuesday will drop as low as 645 megawatts.

From Wednesday onwards, prices will be significantly lower, and the price differences between days will largely disappear. Starting from **Wednesday**, electricity average prices will remain very affordable, below one cent per kWh, continuing through the weekend. **Sunday** will be the cheapest day of the week, with an average price even dipping into negative territory (-0.3 cents). Negative hourly prices will indeed occur on multiple days during the week, particularly at night and early morning hours.

Between Wednesday and Sunday, intraday price variation will remain minor, even though negative hourly prices might occasionally occur. For example, early Wednesday morning between 2‚Äì4 am, prices might fall below zero, dropping as low as -1.2 cents. Similarly, early morning hours on Thursday and Friday will have prices close to zero or slightly negative.

Next **Monday**, the average electricity price will slightly increase but will still remain rather affordable, averaging around 1.4 cents. Monday's highest prices will occur before noon, between approximately 9‚Äì11 am, when prices may rise to around 3.8 cents.

The Tuesday morning price spike clearly stands out due to significantly reduced wind power generation. During the rest of the week, wind power supply is substantial, particularly from Wednesday to Friday, helping to keep prices low.
