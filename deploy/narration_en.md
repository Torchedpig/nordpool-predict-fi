Next week, the price expectations for exchange electricity will vary greatly. On **Monday**, the price of electricity will rise high, and the average price for the day is expected to be as much as 16.0 ¬¢/kWh. Monday's maximum price could rise up to 27.6 cents per kilowatt-hour, partly due to the low amount of wind power, which is predicted to be at its lowest at only 214 MW during the day. Monday's highest price is likely to be during the morning hours, around 8-10 AM.

On **Tuesday**, the average price of electricity will fall to 10.9 cents, but the forecast includes a significant risk of price spikes. Prices for individual hours could rise up to 30-40 cents. The risk of price spikes is related to the morning and early evening hours, when electricity consumption is at its highest. Wednesday's and Thursday's price expectations are similar to Tuesday's.

On **Wednesday**, the average price of electricity is estimated to be 11.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. A high risk of price spikes is also predicted for Wednesday, up to 30-40 cents for individual hours. On **Thursday**, the average price is 9.7 ¬¢/kWh, but the risk of price spikes still exists: the prices of individual hours can rise up to 20-40 cents per kilowatt-hour. The possibility of peak prices is typically during the morning and evening hours.

On **Friday**, the price of electricity will fall significantly. The average price for the day is expected to be only 4.1 ¬¢/kWh. As the weekend approaches, the price of electricity will fall even further. On **Saturday**, the average price will be only 2.0 ¬¢/kWh, and on **Sunday**, it will go below zero, to -0.1 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Sunday, electricity will therefore be almost free, and during the night hours, the price will even become negative.

The low prices of the weekend are explained by the high production of wind power. On Friday, wind power will be available on average 3786 MW, on Saturday 3552 MW, and on Sunday as much as 5289 MW. On Sunday night, wind power will be produced at a maximum of over 5600 MW. Compared to Monday, the difference is huge, as on Monday, the average production of wind power will remain at only 628 MW.
