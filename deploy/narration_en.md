The exchange electricity price forecast for the coming week shows varying figures. On **Thursday**, the price will rise high, and the average price for the day is expected to be as high as 21.8 ¬¢/kWh. Thursday's highest price, 31.1 ¬¢, is likely to occur during the morning hours of 9-11. Very little wind power will be available on Thursday, only 430 MW on average.

On **Friday**, the price of electricity will fall significantly, with an average price of 10.5 ¬¢. Friday's wind power production will be many times higher than Thursday's, averaging 1788 MW, but still at a low level. The price of electricity on Friday is subject to a high risk of price spikes, up to 30-40 cents in individual hours. The most likely high price peaks will occur in the morning hours 7-9.

On **Saturday**, the price will drop very low, and the average price is expected to be only 2.8 ¬¢. During Saturday, there will be a very large amount of wind power, an average of 4902 MW. On Saturday afternoon and early evening, the price of electricity will even dip below zero.

On **Sunday**, **Monday**, next **Tuesday**, and next **Wednesday**, the price of electricity is expected to settle very close to each other, below five cents per kilowatt-hour. On all of these days, there will be a very large amount of wind power available, over 4400 MW on average. Sunday and Monday's average temperatures will remain below zero, but on Tuesday and Wednesday the temperature will rise slightly above zero.

After the weekend, the price of electricity will therefore remain affordable, and the weekend will offer downright cheap electricity. The most expensive electricity will be on Thursday, when wind power is at its lowest and the average temperature is at its lowest.
