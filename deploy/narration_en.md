During the upcoming week, electricity prices will vary considerably from day to day. Prices will peak on **Monday**, when the average daily price will rise to 7.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Monday, the highest prices will occur in the evening from 18:00 to 20:00, reaching almost 18 cents.

The most affordable days will be **Wednesday** and **Sunday**, when the average electricity price will be clearly below three cents. On Wednesday, prices will even dip slightly negative early in the morning between 03:00 and 05:00, reaching as low as -0.1 cents. On Sunday afternoon between 13:00 and 15:00, prices will also become negative, dropping as low as -0.8 cents per kilowatt-hour.

Wind power generation will see significant variations during the week. On Wednesday, abundant wind energy will keep prices low. The wind production on Wednesday will not drop below 4800 MW, and the average wind power availability will be nearly 5800 MW, explaining the day's low price level.

On **Tuesday**, **Friday**, and **Saturday**, forecasts include risks of price spikes. On Tuesday, electricity prices may momentarily rise up to 10 cents higher than the forecasted maximum price of 11.3 cents. On Friday and Saturday, the risk is even higher, with electricity prices potentially spiking up to 20 cents per kilowatt-hour during certain hours.

Towards the end of the week, prices will stabilize somewhat, but during the weekend, prices may still occasionally rise high, particularly on Saturday morning and evening.
