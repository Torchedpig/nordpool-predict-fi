The Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant is currently undergoing maintenance. The maintenance started on 01.03.2025 at 03:00 and is expected to end on 02.05.2025 at 02:00. This maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the forecast, as training data during maintenance periods is limited.

The electricity price forecast for the upcoming week shows clear variations between days. The week's highest prices will be observed on **Thursday**, when the average electricity price will rise to 5.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. **Thursday's** prices are expected to range between 1.5 and 10.2 cents, but there is a notable risk of price spikes: during individual hours, prices may rise as high as 20 cents.

Prices may also rise significantly at certain hours on **Tuesday**. Although Tuesday's average price remains moderate at 4.8 cents, evening hours (approximately between 18:00â€“20:00) are expected to see prices exceed 13 cents. The risk of price spikes is high, and prices might even reach 10â€“20 cents during individual hours. Tuesday's peak prices are partly explained by very low minimum wind power production, dropping below 500 MW.

Public holidays will influence prices this week. **Friday**, **Sunday**, and **Monday** are holidays, which could result in lower-than-usual electricity demand. This will be especially visible on **Sunday**, when the forecast predicts very affordable electricity: the average price will remain just slightly above zero, with minimum prices dropping as low as -2.2 cents during night and daytime hours. No risk of price spikes is expected for Sunday.

On **Wednesday** and **Saturday**, prices will also remain affordable. Wednesday's average price will be 2.5 cents, with negligible risk of price spikes. On Saturday, the average price will be even lower, just 2.1 cents, although the risk for short-term price spikes does exist.

Overall, electricity prices will fluctuate significantly during the coming days. The cheapest hours will generally occur at night, when prices can even become negative. The most expensive hours occur in the evening, particularly on Tuesday and Thursday, when price variations will be largest.
