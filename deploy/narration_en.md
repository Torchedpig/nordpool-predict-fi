Electricity prices on the exchange are expected to remain affordable in the coming days. Average daily prices during the week will range between 0.4 and 2.2 cents. However, price fluctuations within each day are relatively high, and negative electricity prices are likely to occur during several nights.

On **Wednesday**, the week's highest hourly price of 7.4 cents is expected. This price peak is likely to occur in the morning between approximately 7:00 and 9:00. On the same day, however, electricity prices will also dip into negative values during nighttime hours, reaching as low as -0.1 cents around 1:00.

On **Thursday** and **Friday**, daily electricity prices will remain moderate, with no particularly high price peaks expected. On these days, wind power production is at a higher-than-average level, partly explaining the low price.

On **Saturday**, electricity prices will fluctuate notably; from negative prices during the night and afternoon, they will rise to as high as six cents between approximately 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning. On **Sunday**, prices will once again become negative during the morning and daytime, dropping to as low as -1.5 cents around 14:00–15:00, but in the evening, prices will rise significantly, approaching six cents between 19:00 and 21:00.

At the start of next week, prices will again become more moderate. **Monday’s** average price is the week's lowest at only 0.4 cents. Negative hourly prices are expected especially in the early morning hours. **Tuesday’s** average price will also remain low, around one cent, although prices within the day will show some variation.
