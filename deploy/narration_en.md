At the beginning of the week on **Tuesday**, the electricity market price forecast shows significant fluctuations, with the day's maximum price potentially rising to 37.0 ¢/kWh. This high price level is related to the low wind power production during the day, which varies significantly. However, the average price for the day is 11.1 ¢/kWh, indicating that certain moments can be more affordable for electricity users.

On **Wednesday**, electricity prices decrease significantly, with the expected average price at only 4.0 ¢/kWh. This is partly due to the abundant supply of wind power, which lowers prices. Price fluctuations are small throughout the day, providing stability for consumers.

On **Thursday**, the price level remains moderate, with an expected average price of 6.8 ¢/kWh. During the day, wind power production varies less than at the beginning of the week, which can partly support price stability.

On **Friday**, prices rise slightly, with an average price of 7.7 ¢/kWh. This is partly due to the decrease in wind power production compared to previous days. Nevertheless, the day's price peaks are moderate.

On **Saturday**, prices drop again, with an average price of 5.1 ¢/kWh. Wind power production remains steady, promoting a stable price development. Intra-day price fluctuations are small.

On **Sunday** and **Monday**, the risk of price spikes is greater than predicted, with individual hours potentially rising to levels of up to 20 ¢/kWh. Both Sunday and Monday have average prices of 7.7 ¢/kWh, indicating that these days are similar in terms of price formation. Next Monday, price fluctuations will continue, and wind power remains at a reasonable level, influencing the price trend.
