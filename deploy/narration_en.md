*Electricity market prices will remain moderate during the coming week, although temporary price fluctuations are expected over the weekend. Next Thursday's public holiday will bring prices down to their lowest of the week, providing consumers several opportunities to benefit from even negative nighttime electricity rates.*

Olkiluoto 1 nuclear power plant is currently experiencing a production shortfall. The available output is only 50 MW, significantly below its rated 890 MW, resulting in an availability of just 5.6 percent. The shortfall began on 22 May 2025 at 09:00 and is expected to end on 24 May 2025 at 01:00. The production shortfall may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as limited training data is available from periods of maintenance outages.
