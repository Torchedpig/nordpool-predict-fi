Electricity price forecasts for the upcoming week will vary noticeably from day to day. Average prices will mostly remain moderate, but there will be noticeable variability between days. The most notable day is **Thursday**, when the average electricity price will rise to the week's highest level, around 6.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. Thursday's hourly forecasted prices will range between 2.6 and 13.8 cents. Additionally, a significant risk for price spikes has been identified for Thursday, potentially pushing individual hourly prices up to 20â€“30 cents. Peak prices are most likely to occur during morning or evening consumption peaks, for example between 7â€“9 or 17â€“19.

On **Tuesday**, the average electricity price will settle just below four cents, but intra-day fluctuations will be significant, ranging from -0.1 to 14.9 cents. Highest prices will occur in the morning around 6â€“8. During these hours, wind power production is expected to be at a low level, partly explaining the price increase.

The week's cheapest day will be **Sunday**, when the average price will be just 0.2 cents. On Sunday, electricity prices will even turn negative, reaching as low as -0.9 cents. **Monday** will also be inexpensive, with an average price of about 1.6 cents and lowest hourly prices down to -0.6 cents.

On **Wednesday**, **Friday**, and **Saturday**, prices will remain moderate, with daily averages below four cents. On Wednesday, prices will average 2.4 cents with no significant price increases expected. Fridayâ€™s prices will be slightly higher at 3.7 cents, yet still moderate. By Saturday, prices will again decrease slightly, averaging around 2.7 cents.

Negative prices will occur on several days, especially during the night and early morning hours, when electricity consumption is low and supply plentiful.
