The price of electricity on the power exchange will fluctuate significantly during the coming week. On **Friday**, the price will rise to a very expensive level, with an average price of 20.1 ¢/kWh. Friday's maximum price, 36.8 ¢, will occur in the evening between 5 PM and 7 PM. Friday's price is explained by the low wind power production, which will remain at a minimum of only 302 MW during the day.

Prices will fall significantly for the weekend. On **Saturday** and Sunday, the average prices of electricity will already be significantly cheaper. Saturday's average price will be 6.3 ¢ and Sunday's 5.8 ¢. However, on Saturday there is a risk of individual price spikes, even up to 20 cents. On Sunday, prices are expected to remain stable. The low prices of the weekend are explained by abundant wind power production, which is expected to be on average 3200 MW on Saturday and even 3992 MW on Sunday. The freezing temperatures will tighten during the weekend, but there will be so much wind power that it will keep the price of electricity low.

Next **Monday**, the price of electricity will rise again, with an average price of 10.8 ¢. Monday also has a high risk of price spikes, with prices for individual hours potentially rising to 30-40 cents. Wind power will be abundantly available on Monday, but the freezing temperatures will become even more intense.

On **Tuesday** and Wednesday, average prices will remain high, at around 10.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. On Wednesday, however, there is a risk that the prices of individual hours will rise up to 30 cents.

Next **Thursday**, the average price of electricity will decrease slightly, to 9.6 cents. Wind power production will decrease on Thursday, and there is a high risk of price spikes, even 20-40 cents per kilowatt-hour. The most likely time for a price spike is in the morning between 7 AM and 9 AM.
