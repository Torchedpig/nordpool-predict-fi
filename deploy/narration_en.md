Electricity prices are expected to remain mostly affordable in the coming days. Average daily prices will range from less than one cent to around two and a half cents per kilowatt-hour. Differences between days are relatively small, and no single particularly expensive day is anticipated.

On **Wednesday**, the expected average price will be the highest of the week, approximately 2.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. Throughout the day, prices will fluctuate significantly, reaching nearly ten cents around 9:00 in the morning. This is the clearly highest individual hourly price of the week, and there is a risk of price spikes occurring during individual hours on Wednesday.

Approaching the weekend, prices will drop slightly. On **Thursday** and **Friday**, prices will remain below four cents, and overnight on Friday, several hours of negative pricing are expected. On **Saturday**, the average price will settle at 1.8 cents, but intraday prices will vary widely. On Saturday morning, prices could approach nearly six cents, indicating a risk of occasional price spikes.

The week's cheapest days will be **Sunday** and **Tuesday**, both with an average price of just 0.3 cents. Both days will also feature several negative-priced hours. On Sunday morning, prices will be slightly higher, and the risk of price spikes has been separately mentioned.

Next **Monday**, the price forecast remains low, with an average daily price of only 0.6 cents. Some price fluctuations may occur, and the risk of occasional price spikes remains present.

Throughout the week, several periods of negative electricity prices will occur, especially overnight and during afternoon hours on the weekend and early next week.
