The price forecast for exchange electricity for the coming week shows considerable variation. Prices will be cheap on **Tuesday**, when the average price for the day will remain at 0.7 cents per kilowatt-hour, and the price will vary between -0.0 and 2.1 cents during the day. After Tuesday, the price will rise, and exchange electricity will be most expensive on Friday.

On **Wednesday**, the average price of exchange electricity is expected to rise to 7.2 cents. There is also a high risk of price spikes on Wednesday, with prices for individual hours potentially rising as high as 20-30 cents. This is partly due to the low wind power production, which will be at its lowest at only 397 megawatts.

On **Thursday**, the average price will rise further to 9.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. Thursday also has a high risk of price spikes, with prices for individual hours potentially rising as high as 20-40 cents. Wind power production will be at its lowest on Thursday, at only 810 megawatts, which partly explains the rise in prices. Price spikes are expected to occur during the morning and evening hours, around 7-9 AM and 5-7 PM.

**Friday** is forecast to have the highest average price of the week, 10.4 ¢/kWh. The maximum price for Friday is forecast to be 17.6 ¢, but the risk of price spikes is high, and prices for individual hours could rise as high as 30-40 cents. Wind power production will be at its lowest at 1195 MW, which is clearly below the week's average. Price spikes will likely be timed in the morning around 7-9 AM and in the evening around 5-7 PM.

On **Saturday**, the average price of exchange electricity is expected to fall to 8.3 cents. On Saturday, there is still a risk of price spikes, and prices for individual hours can rise to 20-30 cents. On **Sunday**, the average price will fall further to 6.9 cents per kilowatt-hour. There is also a risk of price spikes on Sunday, with prices potentially rising as high as 20 cents during individual hours. Next **Monday**, the price of exchange electricity will settle at 6.0 cents per kilowatt-hour.
