In the upcoming days, electricity price trends show some variability. On **Thursday**, the average price is expected to be 8.8 ¢/kWh, with the highest hourly price reaching up to 15.9 ¢. However, the possibility of price spikes is significant, and prices could rise to 20-40 ¢. Wind power production is average and does not provide significant price support.

On **Friday**, the average price remains at 7.8 ¢, with moderate price fluctuations. However, the minimum wind power is only 1430 MW, which, together with the risk of price spikes, could occasionally raise prices. **Saturday** is expected to have the most affordable average price of the week at 4.7 ¢/kWh, with plenty of wind power available, explaining the low prices.

On **Sunday**, the average price settles again at 7.8 ¢ without significant risk of price spikes. On **Monday**, prices remain at the same level, but wind power production is average, balancing the price trend.

**Tuesday** sees an increase in the average price to 9.4 ¢/kWh. Wind power production is weak, and the possibility of price spikes is high. High prices may occur, particularly in the afternoon. On **Wednesday**, the average price is the highest of the week at 10.4 ¢/kWh, and wind power production is low, partially explaining the high prices. The risk of price spikes is also significant on Wednesday, and unexpectedly high prices may materialize.
