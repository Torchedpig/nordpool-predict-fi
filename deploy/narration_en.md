During the coming week, electricity price forecasts will mostly remain at a low level. Daily average prices will predominantly stay under two cents, and the cheapest day of the week will be **Sunday**, when the average price will even slip slightly below zero to -0,1 cents. On Sunday, electricity prices will mostly remain negative, at their lowest -1,5 cents.

In weekly price comparisons, **Friday** stands out clearly, with the highest average price of the week at 2,4 cents per kilowatt-hour. Friday will see isolated hours of higher prices, and between 8 to 10 in the morning, electricity prices will rise above eight cents, peaking at 10,4 cents. The risk of price spikes on Friday is high, so hourly prices could exceed the forecasted levels.

Weekend days, **Saturday** and Sunday, will clearly be more affordable: in addition to Sunday, Saturday's average price remains very low, only 0,2 cents. Saturday's prices vary between -0,8 cents and 1,7 cents, with many negative hourly prices. The very low prices during Saturday and Sunday are partially due to abundant wind power production, which will be at high levels over the weekend.

On weekdays such as **Monday**, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, prices will return to slightly higher levels but will remain moderate overall. Midweek on Wednesday, the maximum price will momentarily rise to 4,7 cents, but the day's average price will stay below one cent. Thursday's average price, 1,4 cents, will be the second highest of the week after Friday, but price fluctuations will remain modest.

Throughout next week, price levels will remain generally moderate, and significant fluctuations are not expected except for Friday. The occurrence of negative prices, especially during the weekend, illustrates a situation of abundant electricity supply, providing favorable opportunities for consumers to schedule consumption during the cheapest hours.
