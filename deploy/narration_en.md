*Electricity market prices are set to fluctuate notably over the coming week, as individual price spikes during the weekend alternate with cheaper hours on the public holiday. The average price of electricity is expected to decrease as the week progresses and wind power increases, with Thursday forecasted to bring the lowest prices of the week.*

There is currently a maintenance outage at the Loviisa 2 nuclear power plant, which began on 4.5.2025 at 17:00 and is expected to end on 8.5.2025 at 20:00. The maintenance outage may affect the accuracy of the price forecast, as there is limited training data available for periods with similar outages.

The forecast was last updated on Thursday at 14:24.

Electricity price forecasts for the week show variation, especially between the weekend and the start of next week. **Friday** and **Saturday** are expected to see average prices near eight cents per kilowatt-hour. On these days, the highest hourly prices will exceed 15 cents, with **Friday's** peak reaching as high as 19.3 cents—particularly during the early morning (7–9 a.m.) and early evening hours, when wind power production is exceptionally low. Minimum wind power output falls below 150 megawatts on these days, explaining the price increases. On Saturday, the risk of price spikes is greatest in the morning (8–10 a.m.), when electricity prices may momentarily surge.

**Sunday** is a public holiday, which is reflected in both lower electricity demand and expected prices. The average price drops to four cents, and the lowest hourly price even turns negative for a moment in the afternoon (3–5 p.m.). During these hours, wind power output is significantly higher than during the rest of the weekend, contributing to lower prices. However, individual hourly price spikes may still occur on Sunday, particularly in the afternoon and early evening.

Next **Monday** and **Tuesday** are expected to continue the downward price trend as average wind power output increases. Average prices settle around four cents or less, and maximum prices on Tuesday remain clearly below ten cents. On **Wednesday**, moderate prices continue as wind power output peaks for the week. The most affordable day is **Thursday**, when the average price falls to 1.7 cents per kilowatt-hour, and maximum prices remain noticeably lower than earlier in the week. On Thursday, hours with negative prices are predicted for the afternoon.

In summary, the start of the week will be marked by higher price levels, especially due to low wind power and Saturday's price spikes, but as the public holiday passes and wind power increases, prices are expected to stabilize. Negative hourly prices are forecast for Sunday and Thursday, when supply is abundant. Individual hourly peaks are expected mainly during the weekend and potentially on Monday and Tuesday.
