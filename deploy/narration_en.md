During the upcoming week, electricity spot prices will vary significantly from day to day. **Tuesday** stands out most clearly, with an average electricity price of 6.5 cents per kilowatt-hour and a peak price reaching 22.8 cents between 7:00 and 9:00. After the highest morning prices on Tuesday, electricity prices will quickly fall, dropping below one cent per kWh between 18:00 and 23:00. Tuesday evening hours will thus be particularly inexpensive.

On **Wednesday**, electricity prices will drop exceptionally low, even reaching negative levels overnight. At their lowest, prices will be -1.6 cents between midnight and 2:00. Wednesday's average price will remain very low, at just 0.3 cents. This is due to strong wind conditions, keeping wind power production at high levels throughout the day.

On **Thursday**, prices will rise again significantly, averaging 5.5 cents. Thursday will see considerable price fluctuations, with morning prices peaking at 17.5 cents between 8:00 and 10:00. A special warning has also been issued for Thursday regarding potential price spikes, during which prices could temporarily climb above 20 cents. This risk is associated with very low wind power production during morning hours.

On **Friday**, electricity prices will calm somewhat, with an average daily price of 3.8 cents. However, the possibility of price spikes remains, and prices could momentarily reach as high as 10 cents. The highest prices on Friday will occur between 20:00 and 22:00.

Over the weekend, electricity prices will remain moderate. **Saturday's** average will be only 2.7 cents, although a small risk remains for higher price spikes of around 10 cents. On **Sunday**, the average price will be close to Saturday's level, around three cents, with a similar small risk of approximately 10-cent price spikes.

Next **Monday**, electricity prices will rise somewhat again, with an average daily price of 5.8 cents. No price spike risks are forecasted for that day, so prices will remain steadier compared to earlier in the week.
